"This is not a review for the iPad, but a warning that Amazon is linking the 2018 iPads with Apple Pencil 1 to purchase them together — THEY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER. 2018 iPad Pros and newer use the Apple Pencil 2.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I use my iPad every day for work, not as a computer replacement but as as enhancement. For the most part I review and annotate (many) documents, take notes during meetings, create vector graphics, and make presentations (it is better for that purpose than a laptop, IMO). And yes I also use it for entertainment.Because I use it so much, I decided to upgrade and I don't regret the decision despite the dent in my wallet. The form factor is seriously much more of an improvement than I expected; my wife still refuses to believe the screen is the same size as the previous model (it is). The apple pencil is a slight improvement in terms of operation -- it feels a bit nicer, and I won't miss the removable cap -- but the convenience of attaching it to the side of the device for storage and charging is a game-changer. I no longer have to remember to charge it over-night every few days. I also have the smart folio and it is an excellent improvement over the previous version.The iPad Pro is simply the best-in-class tablet device. The screen is beautiful, it is crazy fast, and the apps are excellent. Since I store my files on iCloud, integration is seemless: documents that I annotate appear on my computer within seconds after changing them. So it is not a laptop replacement for me, but I used it almost as much as I use my laptop.Yes there are some limitations. I'm a heavy Excel user and the iPad version is crippled since macros don't work. I can review and annotate others' spreadsheets, however, which I find more convenient then text boxes or cell comments. I also use LaTeX (rather than Word) and I haven't found anything close to Emacs + AucTeX. And I can't use R on the tablet.Regarding cost: yes , it is expensive. But over its lifetime it will more than justify the expense for me. And, like all Apple products, they are built to last (I still use a 2010 iMac at home as a spare computer and it is quite usable) and they retain their resell value.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"I had the last 10.5"" ipad pro and just upgraded to the new 12.9. I had actually returned the previous gen 12.9 and switched to the 10.5 because it was too large. However, with the minimum bezels on this new ipad, the size is perfect. I love using it for reading news, browsing the web, imessage, netflix/youtube, etc. The screen is incredible, and it never lags. Apple doesn't have much competition for great tablets, and this new generation made the gap even larger. It's expensive, but if you have the money then it's a great device.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I use the 2018 iPad Pro 12.9 for 8-12 hours a day for work and play.  To set it up, I just set my iPad Air next to it, and it quickly and automatically transferred everything (apps, settings, etc.).The sound system is beyond belief, with an incredible depth and breadth and richness.  I've had systems with surround sound that didn't sound as good as this tiny critter.  (I was astounded, while watching a movie, when a truck drove across the screen, from right to left, and the sound started in the right speakers and moved to the left speakers as the truck crossed the screen.)  I have hypersensitive hearing and can turn this down very low and still hear every sound and word perfectly.You're just smashing, Apple!  Thank you.  (Plus, your little iPad Air is going on four years now and is still going strong as a backup to this one.)","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Apple is so far ahead of the curve when it comes to tablets that at this point they are competing with themselves. This thing is fast and the design is beautiful. It is also expensive but I don't regret buying it at all (got the 12.9 64gb wifi from apple). My only concern with the device is durability but I'll take really good care of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"My iPad Pro 12.9” (3rd Gen) is useless to give a presentation, because of Apple's removal of the headphone jack. :-(Most state-of-the-art, large-scale conference venues use HDMI, but with all of the audio being handled via a plain old analog headphone jack.Apple's own USB-C adapters for HDMI and VGA do not include a headphone jack, making the iPad Pro a no-go for professional presentations. :-(Numerous 3rd-party USB-C A/V adapters have headphone jacks, most of which do not extract the audio from HDMI and are therefore useless.Of seven that I tried, only one properly extracted / separated the audio and sent it out the headphone jack at all times.To make matters worse, Apple enforces HDCP even on my own presentations, so I was at the mercy of the A/V techs (very pro) to employ a sketchy hardware device, a la, HDCP ""spoofer"" to make the HDMI work with their projection / repeaters at a world-class conference venue. :-(I love everything about the portability and versatility and performance of the new iPad Pro, but this one issue is an utter catastrophe and a complete deal-breaker re: the viability of the iPad ""Pro"" in the REAL professional workplace.TO APPLE:  Please add a headphone jack on your A/V adapters and turn off HDCP for non-protected content.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Update 4/15/2018: I unfortunately have to downgrade my initial 5 star rating. Recently my iPad has exhibited the dreaded intermittent ‘unresponsive touch screen’. This issue seems to occur in a lot of these iPads a few months after ownership. Look it up online and you’ll see many of these iPads end up this way. Apple, as usual, is useless in fixing the problem, or even admitting anything is wrong. The ‘genius’ customer service is anything but. I would bring mine in for a replacement, but after a lot of research, it appears the same issue often occurs on the replacement devices, so I’m not going to gamble. It’s still usable, but imagine as you’re scrolling, the ‘touch screen’ suddenly because a regular screen, not registering your touch for a few seconds, before it starts working again. It’s beyond annoying. It’s definitely an issue that many will encounter. I mean seriously?! A touch screen device that has issues with an unresponsive screen?! Come on?!————-(Original Review upon purchase)I was always skeptical about the idea of a tablet replacing the need for a laptop, but this new IPad Pro comes close to making me think it’s possible. I’ve been using the 12.9 IPad for a few years now (I had the previous gen one as well), and it’s progressively becoming my daily computing tool for just about everything except for photoshop—interesting enough, a full photoshop will be released for iOS later 2019...we’ll see how that goes.The power is plentiful; at this point, I haven’t used any apps that even come close to tapping into its full performance power. One of the biggest issues I’ve had regarding devices like this is the battery life. If you’re using it daily, and running on battery all the time, the battery will not last very long overall. My experience is that in less than 2 years the battery wants to go—in the case of my previous IPad Pro, the battery life was abyssal after only 1 year of moderate use. This isn’t very acceptable for something that you’re potentially going to use everyday (or a ‘pro’ machine?!). What I do now is leave the charger plugged in (I’m using a slightly more powerful 29W adapter). I’ll unplug maybe once every week, or two weeks sometimes, to let the battery drain.The smaller screen bezels is a nice touch and the absence of the physical home button is just fine. Can’t argue with more screen. As for accessories, I skipped the ‘smart keyboard’; it’s a waste of money in my opinion the new keyboard design has issues of its own. I’ve been using apple’s wireless Bluetooth keyboard, and I much prefer that, as you’ll have more workspace versatility—although you’ll have to carry two pieces of equipment around; a good excuse to get a nice bag to put them in.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"Ordered this for my Son who has one more semester left of College. To replace the ipad we bought him for High School graduation-2015. He LOVVVVVVVES IT. Expensive, but worth every penny. As was the first one. He was so impressed with clarity, speed, volume, speakers and how he just pressed a button and transferred all his info from iphone over to new ipad. I believe he did so with old ipad to new ipad also. He said it was sooo fast. Perfect to start his career with in June. No more big ole' laptaps. I gave him the choice....the new 12.9ipad pro or another HP laptop. Which by the way still works AWESOME. (Got this for him to use for High School his junior yr. And it is still works perfectly for him). He chose the ipad 12.9 because it will be easier to carry for his new career. Thank you Amazon for getting it here on time. The first one I ordered...well I still have not seen that one. Called Amazon on Friday morning before Christmas and told them I still hadn't received it yet.  And Saturday I had my ipad. Awesome!!! Thank you again Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"you spend $1000 and they put nothing but functional charger. they eliminated 3.5 jack so evevry one had to buy 3.5 to lighting adapter, yeah they put it in the box for up to iPhone X but who kept that not losing it?now they changed to USB type-C. still no 3.5mm jack. Sound work important for me, so I downgraded from iPhone X, 7 to 6S plus. now this time, I returned this thing. I am keeping my iPad Pro 2nd Gen. Apple Bluetooth products are ok but not for sound work quality at all. all those lighting adapters, and USB-C adapter thing destroyed the quality of sound. so I thought they made amazing wireless transmission for Bluetooth devices they offer, but heck no. people who listened to crappy earbuds ALWAY praise apple air pod or stock earbud. well, they never had even $69.99 earbud and have no clue what good sound is like. Apple cellphones and iPad have good interface and OS and hardware, but it looks like this it. My 6S is going to be my last iPhone and iPad Pro 2nd gen will be my last iPad. they did not even include USB-C adapter in this over $1000 products and apple Net Profit is 13%, very high compared to any corporation in any industry in any country. They are even famous for not distributing a dividend to stockholders that resulted in warning from the gov. and I can not charge and work together, they don't even put lastest battery cells which are lighter, higher capacity, charges faster, with longer life cycle and better capacity retention. Samsung Batteries are GUARANTEED TO LOSE ONLY 2% capacity in TWO years since 2017. come on apple.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"First, let me admit that yes, this thing is expensive. Add on an Apple Pencil and ""expensive"" starts to border on ""ridiculously expensive."" The good news is that it's worth every penny. Prior to purchasing the iPad Pro, I purchased a screen tablet for use with my Mac. I figured that I'd end up using the iPad when I was out and about and use the screen tablet when I was home. And that's what happened initially. Now I rarely use the screen tablet.One of the reasons I justified getting the iPad was the news that Photoshop (real, full Photoshop) would be coming to iOS some time soon. I didn't figure that anything out there was as feature complete as Photoshop for art purposes. I quickly found, however, that Procreate is close enough (and getting better all the time). Coupled with the 2nd generation Pencil, Procreate gives me everything I need to create art in a way that feels almost identical to traditional media (there will always be somewhat of a disconnect).On the productivity front, I can Remote Desktop into the servers at work and do anything I would normally need a laptop for right on the iPad. And the large screen makes it a great experience.Performance is insane. I never feel like I'm having to wait on the iPad to do anything. The screen is brilliant (I have a matte finish screen protector applied to give the screen some ""tooth"" while drawing, so it's not as colorful looking as it is unadorned, but it's still beautiful). Battery life is exceptional (though not as great as the iPad Air that I came from). USB Type C connectivity is a welcome addition. All in all, it's a great product. It might actually be the best piece of hardware that Apple is making currently, given the complaints with the current line of MacBook Pros.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Apple is so cheap...you now have to buy an adapter for headphone because the only input is the USB-C jack. They don’t tell you this when you buy it. You have to learn the hard way that there is no headphone jack. And, you cannot charge while using headphones because the charging input is being used for headphones. They also do not tell you that the screen size is diagonal, so a 12.9” screen is really under 11”. They are becoming too greedy and this will probably be my last Apple product ever because of shady advertising practices and undisclosed buy-ups that you need to function.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Got this as replacement for an ultra portable windows machine; and got it at the same time as the surface pro.To be honest; it is yet another ipad; expensive one, but that's a given, being Apple-made. Quality is good; feel solid and the screen is great. Is it worth the price? For me no; but for you that may depend.I am a developer, and I manage, so my needs are portability; touch screen and ability to do my work anywhere. While an ultra portable laptop is great; I wanted the touch capability; especially via pen or some similar devices.Got this device, and from the first time I used it, it felt exactly like an ipad; I have an Air, that I use for light productivity; which is totally inadequate for most of my work; and sadly, this device is in the same group, being an oversized ipad.The os is still iOS; which is great if all you do is use apps, but I write code, so I need compilers, I need 2d and 3d apps to do my job; and for the managing part, I need to take notes and address tasks. Some of these activities can be done with the ipad pro; but I assume when they made this device, they marketed it for artists or people with disposable income, that just use mail and surf internet. Which is not me.I can't use this as desktop device, since the screen is small, the keyboard attachment is also serviceable but not great, and compared to other small form factor devices, that can support docks and full connections to external devices, this one doesn't make the cut.As portable device, it is OK, but I can't code on it. Can't use any 3d engine IDE, and unless I want to write text files and then send them to my dropbox to be then imported in Xcode or Visual studio, I can't really write any meaningful code.iOS limit the apps I can run on this device; which is a beast if we speak in terms of raw power. But Apple was able to put a 600 HP engine in a Geo, which means that you will be happily overpay for a small city car that could do much more, but for some reasons, it is crippled.Pretty sure that artists will love this device, so they can run at the speed of light while drawing; but if you plan to use this as desktop replacement, look toward a surface pro. You get a full Windows OS there, and a dock that transform your tablet into a laptop or a desktop replacement. On top of that, you can make it dual boot and install either Linux or OSX on the surface; and that open up a world of possibilities.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"I absolutely love this iPad. I have always been a computer person, but since I got this product my workflow has changed for the better. I use this iPad every day to write notes, read books, watch movies, etc. I have even used it to give a  lecture on campus. The screen display is gorgeous and I prefer watching movies and TV series here than in my computer screen. Owning this iPad  and using it to take notes has convinced me on going paperless, since writing with a new Apple Pencil feels great, even better than writing with pencil and paper in my opinion. This is the first Apple product that I own and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the apps that are available. The battery life for this device is really good,  lasting over a day of frequent use. The performance is excellent, it has never frozen, lagged, restarted, or glitched in over a month of daily use. I recommend this product if you are looking for something reliable to take notes digitally and consume media like books and videos on the go.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"One star for shipping, Lazership a company that amazon uses to deliver in NYC, Lazership guys will also open the package to see what it is, not enough people complain to amazon about this company. I wish amazon could give me the option of having Fedex or ups deliver because then they would actually deliver to my door, (i would pay extra for this). The Ipad is great I use it for reading pdf's and after i turn off all other services and deactivating all apps i dont use i get about 30 to 40mins of reading time to 1% of battery use. Screen at 20% to 30% brightness.  also if you switch to black and white mode you will get a few more min per % of battery.

"Beautiful!  Wonderful!  Amazing!  I absolutely love it.  Gorgeous picture...great sound...user friendly.  I am a senior citizen and was concerned that I might not be up to date enough to benefit from this new iPad.  No problem!  My kids laugh at how much I love my new friend.  I am having fun, learning lots of new things and enjoying some great entertainment.  Worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Upadte 2: while traveling, my husband notice the screen cracked. Not even a year old and screen cracked. We don’t even know how, just appeared one day. Looked at prices to replace screen, but they are way over priced like always with Apple products. I put a case around it and will continue to use it that way since the crack is in the corner and doesn’t really bother us. Not happy with iPad thus far, was my first Apple purchase for me and so far, had dead unit, and screen crack???, think it might have been due to heat, but can not say for sure. It was fine after we landed, a week later it sat on a table and then the crack appeared. I also wish it was more user friendly. I think next time even thou I don’t like Windows to much either, I might go with a surface. Expensive and well expensive.... everything.Update: after Apple got me a “new” one, which i think after buying the new one and it being broken out of the box, they gave me a refurbish one. So I was a little like what the because 1200, and now a refurb? But the new one is working well. I use it to teach my son at home, and of course we also use it for fun sometimes.The one thing that I hate about Apples, well more then one it the storage issues, and price so high. I not sure you get what you pay for. I have figured out how to get extra storage, but I wonder why Apple doesn’t just allow for a port that would make it a lot easier. I have done computer support for years and have stayed away from Apple for reason of price, user friendliness and storage issues. My husband got me the iPhone, which I would gladly have taken another with better storage options. This unit does work well for what I needed it for, but again I think I could have gotten Android way cheaper and done the same stuff. I have the 12.9 “, and it is nice to work on the bigger screen. I have not had any issues except for the beginning dead unit. Apple IOS is more stable then Windows, but I have had a few apps just close down in the middle of working. It is a nice tablet that could use a few improvements, especially for the price.So right out the box, my unit came powered on and had  86% battery. Problem was charger was not charging the  unit. I talked with Amazon support who did basics unplug, new wall outlet... Then patch me to Apple support who had me reset the unit and then he tried to remote in but was unable, so next day I went to Apple store. So after awhile find out brand new unit is the issue broken and they could order one or I could see if Amazon would take it back. Support did there jobs. I have to wait now to get the next one and see if it works. This was my first time I purchased an apple device and it did not go well thus far. I had someone buy me an iPhone, but I have had that in the shop as well. Apple products use to be so good. I hope they get back to quality product. Will try and update this once I finally get a working unit. Good thing I can still use my old tablets right now for what I need for school.....","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"I had iPad Pro 12.9 1st gen and it’s still fast and good but that new 2018 iPad Pro is really beautiful. I like how fast I’m able to unlock it using face ID and display is more crisp and clear. I had MacBook Pro but I barely use it because I’m able to to do almost anything on my iPad Pro. The only thing I find frustrating is the very small 3ft charging cable (1st gen had 6ft)","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Upgraded from the iPad Air from at least 3 years ago, and it was a great iPad. I have had an iPad since the day the original one released and to see how far it has come with the 12.9"" Pro is astonishing. It is one of the best screens ever. And the Pencil 2 works like a dream.I primarily use it for split-screen with the Kindle app and Notability. You can also see two Bible verse translations side-by-side on the super popular YouVersion Bible app. I love to have the NIV and the NRSV side by side, scrolling along with each other, able to highlight in both.Using the pencil to highlight on the Kindle is amazing, and having more than 1 color is a nice feature. I love having all my highlights for every book I read and all my notes in Notability. The handswriting features in Notability are stellar.My daughter uses it for Procreate and it is awesome what she can do. It seems professional quality and is quite fun to use also.Can't go wrong and they won't update the Pro until at least November 2019, but maybe even later than that, as they are not all on yearly update cycles like the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I received an shipment this morning of a new ipad pro.  The box felt a little heavy, but it's my first ipad, so I didn't think anything of it.  Upon opening the amazon box, there was a new looking ipad pro box, wrapped in plastic with a barcode, and all of the labels for the item on the backside of the box.  It looked legit to me :(.  So I cut the plastic and lifted the cover revealing a stack of printer paper in the box, and nothing else","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I have had an iPad since the iPad 2. Here is what I have had so far.iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Air , iPad Air 2, iPad mini Retina. Now this .First ill say this its a BEAST. But loving it. The screen is bright responsive and just incredible. So far the best tablet for artists and video professionals.. I paired this with a NEVO G2 tablet stand, A Rav Power Filehub (latest model) and a ZUGU CASE The Muse Case - 2018 iPad Pro 12.9 inch 3rd Gen case and WOW very awesome setup. I do have an older still working Bluetooth keyboard that matches this setup VERY nicely. If you want something that is lightning fast and great for illustration and work this is it. Battery life could be a tad better though.. The file hub for importing video files. Make sure your using 5G. its the easiest way to get video into this tablet. And the NEVO G2 tablet stand is an amazing stand its very well built and allows for a lot of different positions without risking your tablet falling. It locks the tablet in place well and even can accommodate the ZUGU Case with Apple Pencil so you do not even have to remove the case or Pencil. If your a professional get this tablet its well worth the price of admission.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"At first I was a bit skeptical at spending all this money on a tablet, when I could buy a nice tv. However it was totally worth it. I didn’t want a laptop because it seemed to clunky for what I desired, so I went with the iPad which is a more fun way of doing work. I’m more inclined to use the iPad than a laptop. The processing power followed by its nearly 4K quality screen (the iPad’s screen being 2732 by 2048 resolution and 4K being 3840 by 2160 resolution) makes the iPad not only a great laptop replacement (especially with the upcoming iPad OS) it also makes for a great gaming and media consumption device.PS: Battery life is great for how much energy it takes for great quality sound and a great quality screen. Also gets charged quickly with the new USB type C.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"DOA - Received my NEW iPad today.  It would not turn on; black screen.  Charged it for 2 hours.  Did a hard reboot 15 or more times.  Nothing.  DEAD.  I then contacted Apple, they advised me to take it to the store to run a diagnostic test to determine the issue. They tried to restore device in iTunes to reset to factory condition. Still nothing.  They were nice enough to give me a new iPad and let me buy Apple Care.  Also, if you buy, make sure you check the serial numbers purchase date.  Mine was Oct 29th.  That is the date your 1 year warranty begins.  Very important to check.  I will NEVER buy an iPad on Amazon again.  Too many unknowns!!!  I’m glad it worked out for me and the Apple Store was awesome!!!!!! I love my new iPad that I got from the Apple store.  Just be careful what your getting.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is my second iPad-Pro.  The first one crashed and burned after only three years (touch screen froze and the folks at the Apple Store Technical Service  tried but couldn't do it.)The only problems with this one is strictly, so far, with Apple itself and their seeming lack of continuity or care.  The first one has a power supply cord with a USB connector to connect to the transformer and  plug to charge the iPad.  I bought a spare in case the wire wore out, for $40.  This new one has a completely different set-up.  There is no USB end to the transformer.  It can't be connected to  my HP laptop, as the other one could, to commect with iTunes for service help,  for example.  The power cord on this new one is also four feet shorter than the other.  I now need an extension cord for the power cord.I called Apple Customer Service.  The nice lady cheerfully said it's perfectly OK to use the previous transformer and its USB connector,  Same voltage.That's true.  But wrong!  The problem is that Apple re-engineered the plug to connect to the iPad.  The ones I have are incompatical and won't fit. They're useless. This one came with no USB  connection line.  Does that cost extra?  Don't know yetThe first one came with an earphone jack, which is nice when on an airplane, as example.  This one doesn't.  They both have Blue Tooth, so that's about another $100 for a high-quality set.The ""Trusted Phone Number"" for getting security codes over and over again to prove who I am has changed.  I'm no longer in the state or even country where I bought the first one and now have a different phone number.  It's a land line. then and it is now. When setting this new one up to regain my account, it recognized my ID and password.  No problem.  Then, to prove who I am, it will send their six-digit code to me -- over my ""Trusted Phone Number.""  Over 1,500 miles away.Apple customer service essentially said ""tough.  It's your problem, we can't help.  You have to do it yourself.""  The option was to get someone to get to my ""Trusted Phone Number"" there (it was still active, fortunately) and call me immediately with the codes -- before they timed-out.  The alternative was to go through a laboreousprocess that could take over a week.Once I FINALLY got this new iPad Pro active, I could finally change my ""Trusted Phone Number.""Again, when it works, I think the product is great.  Justv expect a hassle if there's an issue.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"I imagine if you are reading reviews you are more interested in user experience than specs, so I’ll just say that this is my third iPad in about 7 years, and it comes very close to replacing my laptop.  iPad OS will add even more capabilities, but I already feel like I can manage my workflow on the iPad Pro.  File management is still not ideal, but it’s hard to fault the iPad for that as it’s not the main purpose.If you can justify buying the bigger screen, I would highly recommend it!  It’s no bigger than a legal pad (even with a case), and I have always been happy to have the space, whether I’m showing documents to clients or watching movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Very light-weighted compared to the 2nd gen and previous iPad versions. Apple designs it with almost full screen utilization that makes the iPad size smaller to the 2nd gen but keeping the same 12.9 screen size. Battery is Okay. I use it mainly for high resolution games and movies. I would suggest to go with 1TB if you are a heavy gamer and play mostly high resolution games. The data and updates will take up the majority of the space and will fill up your storage very quickly. Battery is fine. It normally lasts two days till recharge. I wish it can have the option with the white version just like 2nd gen. Hope they have it there on the next gen. It does not comes with Home button which takes me a while to figure out all the possible gestures as I’m used to the previous version of iPad. The screen edge is also very thin which leaves very limited space to the front camera. I find it a common issue to constantly having my finger block the front camera which iPad use it for face recognition. The type C port is also new to me. I normally use my iPhone charger for my iPad, but this new port type makes things more complicated. I would suggest purchasing a type c to usb connector, otherwise, you would need to bring additional charger for long travel.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is by far the best iPad on the market. The screen is beautiful and it is better than my surface pro 4 for the pen interface. I love procreate and I have enjoyed using it for the last month now. The battery can drain if you are running a high graphics game. (Example: I was playing civilization and the battery lasted about 5 hours, it has to process a lot of information when you are on turn 400 and it accounts for every unit and every city, probably around 200 actions to process each turn.)I love the tablet it’s ease of use is the main reason for my getting it, compared to any computer, this is quicker and more conventient. When I only have a couple minutes to do something the iPad is the only solution when compared to other computers and tablets.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"So far so good!  I love it.  It’s has been a little difficult to find the accessories I want because it’s so new....either there isn’t an option yet or options are limited.  I don’t love the boxy-feeling edges, but that’s just me - you pay for how Apple products feel or make you feel.  It’s a little heavier than I expected, but I’ll live.  I’d definitely buy this again if I had to do it over.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I upgraded from a gen 1 iPad Pro 12.9 that I have used daily for work and personal use over the last 3 years. My old iPad Pro was experiencing intermittent “screen insensitivity”- I am offering it life coaching. I have been an Apple aficionado for nearly 30 years (oof- getting old).PROS-The Apple Pencil 2 experience is significantly improved, writes:draws very smoothly-faster processor “feels” a bit quicker-larger on board storage capacity is nice-on board pencil charging is niceCONS- “Face ID and swiping” is significantly less convenient than a simple “home” button. For a design-centered company who also makes technology products this is a “miss”.-The charging cable is a USB C with 2 male ends. So, if some of your tech isn’t brand new you will need an adapter or different cable that “may or may not” work. Extra cost, extra inconvenience.-Thin body “flexes” more than my old one-Expensive-still no OLED screen (yeah I know, that would add a lot to the cost)For something that costs as much as a VERY nice laptop and is in gen 3 I’d expect improvements rather than stepping back. Part of me is wondering if I shouldn’t have just bought a Gen 2 ipad, kept the “home” button and saved a few bucks. The other part of me uses the Apple Pencil 2 A LOT and tells that other part to shut up and get with the program.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"This iPad is so powerful and capable for your average consumer and artists alike. Paired with a good keyboard, and soon with the new iPad OS (13) enabling a wireless mouse - it's the most portable and secure Apple computer/tablet yet.I love drawing and designing on this. I was a little shocked by how small it looked at first with the new bezel design/face ID. I liked the first iPad pros because of how considerable they looked, but I can't deny how much better this looks, how smart and more convenient this is. And the screen size is still there. They should've made the screens even bigger!Face ID is so quick, and I love that A. it works in every orientation, and B. it tells you when you're covering the camera. Fool proof. Charging my apple pencil and smart keyboard on it is effortless. Colors and definition on the screen are gorgeous. And with continual software updates, this iPad will just get better and more capable. I purchased the 64GB model and I'm so happy I did. Unless you work with a LOT of video/local HD files and don't have a Computer/alternative storage to transfer things to, I can't fathom why you'd need more. So far my apps hardly need storage, and even though the camera is great. I don't see myself taking a lot of photos on this like I would my iPhone. Procreate files are very light, and that was my biggest concern when deciding on capacity. If you don't need a lot of HD video files offline and have somewhere to transfer your data - you'll be sitting on free storage and you're better off saving yourself the money and investing in the apple pencil/wireless keyboard/USB-C hub.Surface Pro, Apple is catching up! Better watch out.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"I purchased Third generation iPad and Apple Pencil 1(Linked with iPad Pro 12.9 3rd Gen) as a surprise gift for my son.This is not a review for iPad or Apple Pencil 1 but as one reviewer said earlier that Amazon linked Apple Pencil 1 purchase with 3rd generation of iPad and this Apple pencil 1 is not compatible with third generation iPad. I will not be as brutal as other reviewer of giving 1 star but this mistake will unnecessarily put customer through hassle of return and refund. So please wait for availability of Apple pencil 2 to use with 3rd generation iPad. Amazon though provided refund for pencil, I lost some of the original refund as pencil was wrongly purchased due to its linking with purchase of this iPad. Apple Pencil 1 description do not mention any thing on compatibility with 3rd generation iPad so I have to admit this one as my mistake for not doing proper research. Still gave 4 stars for linking wrong pencil with this iPad and not for performance of either of devices due to their refund policy.Now the fun begins.....When brand new iPad was in process of setup its screen stuck on Apple Logo and never moved out of it even after going through tech support or hard reboot processes on device or through iTunes.  iPad remained stuck on apple logo right out of the box I was never able to go to home screen. This killed all the joy that my son could have for having new i pad for his early Christmas gift. He only got surprise factor of having new iPad but a non functioning one.I believe that this is ""rare"" failure for third generation well advertised flagship iPad from Apple. I took iPad to Apple Store and they placed my iPad in ""Device Capture"" to send it to their research team for root cause analysis for this booting failure. Though I was not able to use iPad I still gave 4 stars for their exceptional service on replacing my iPad. Unfortunately no Apple store carries that iPad so I have to wait for my device to be delivered to Apple store. One star less for spoiling fun for my son of having new iPad.Only other part Apple is not good about is when they are in transition mode they fails to provide transition cables with iPad. This iPad have cable for charging and data that has USB-c on both end. i.e one end goes to iPad and one end goes to chargers. Prior generation iPad had USB-A port on charger end and lightning apple pin on iPad side. If someone wants to connect this iPad to desktop computer or Mac to use iTunes or large data transfer they will not be able to do it if their CPU or Macs are more than one year old. You have to purchase additional cable that have USB-A on one side and USB-c on other. Newer Windows CPU and Mac has USB-c ports but most people will not have newer CPUs or Mac that have USB-c ports. It is imperative for Apple to provide transition cables to reduce financial pain and wastage of time for their customer. Japanese electronic companies always provide additional cables of various types when they are in transition from one technological point to another. Not seen with Apple even though they sits on billion of cash.Hope this will help customers what to expect from 3rd generation iPad pro and what you should and should not purchase while getting this new iPad.I will still give one last missing star if Apple/Amazon will find some way to bring back the lost smile that my son had.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I own an original iPad, and felt it was time to get a new one. The iPad Pro has great screen quality and is thinner than the original iPad. The software is very fast and smooth as you would expect from a new Apple product. However the battery life seems to go down slightly faster than the original iPad. I did not perform any actual test, this is just personal experience. With that said the iPad pro does charge faster. This is probably due to Apple using USB-C instead of their lightning plug.The new iPad pro charger has change from Apple's unique lightning plug to the standard USB-C plug. You will not be able to use old iPad chargers on this new Pro model or vice versa.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"I bought a 2nd Gen iPad in 2011.  As with all my Apple products, I thought it would be great, being someone who loves technology and the design and user-friendliness of Apple products in particular despite the cost differential over other ""similar"" products.  The next six years, I had a very expensive paperweight.  Not that the iPad wasn't a great product, but rather I always found myself using my iPhone or my iMac.  After 6 years, I gave it to my mother and chalked the $1000 I had spent up to a learning experience.  A few months ago, I decided to scratch the itch of wanting a new tech tool to experience the iPad's evolution from 2011 to now.  I told myself this time it would be different.  Girl, is it ever.  I decided to go for the 12.9-inch, 256GB iPad Pro with cellular service.  Go big or go home, right? More like, go big and no need to go home!  Paired with the 3rd Gen case with keyboard, I bring the new toy with me everywhere I go and don't run into the feeling that I have to wait until I get home to my iMac to accomplish what I would like to.  The speed, the ease of use, the beautiful image quality and the sleek design.  I am constantly using this iPad.  The only ""regret"" I have is opting for the 2nd Gen Pencil at the same time.  I don't use it often.  Maybe I need to explore the advantages of the pencil, and hopefully I will, but I definitely could have gotten by without it.  I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Larger, a litte bit faster, but not really better than my old iPad-2. The screen reacts very insensitive. Very often I have to touch a letter 3 -5 times intensively to get it written. An old Apple-disease which is still sticking at the newest Model. Bad!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I've always stuck to the Android devices, phones tablets, etc.  I wanted a tablet for art and drawing.  Samsung makes the 10.5"" Galaxy Tab S4 that is a really nice device.  The drawing/art/writing on the Samsung devise does not compare well when using both devises together.  I purchased the Tab S4 and still have it as it is a really nice device for most uses.  I'd give the Tab S4 a five star rating if I were to review it.  However, the drawing/art/writing does come close to the Ipad Pro.  When using the Samsung, there is a noticeable lag when writing or drawing.  When I write slowly, the lag is imperceptible; when I write more quickly, the lag becomes more apparent.  Also, the pen with the Samsung is not nearly as nice as the pen you can buy with the IPAD Pro 12.9 2018.  The pen is expensive, but I find it is really worth the money as it provides an experience that no other device I've tried can come close to.  If I compare the Samsung to the Ipad Pro without consideration for writing/drawing/art, I would honestly rate them equally for my use.  The pen experience with the Ipad is amazing, though.  How ironic that Samsung has been perfecting its pen use for a decade (Samsung Note phones and tablets) while Apple spends a couple years developing its pencil and it is decisively better.  I love Samsung products (tablets, phones), but for my use in writing/sketching/art the Apple is clearly the better device.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Pretty amazing tablet! The apple pencil feels great- second to the feel of Wacom products. Procreate is a nice and intuitive app as well.Personally, I enjoyed the new iPad Pro but I am returning the 12.9” I bought on Amazon to instead purchase the 11” one instead- I found it to be too large for my needs. If you prefer a larger screen for drawing I would recommend the larger one. For me, I already own a Wacom Cintiq 22” so I found it to be a bit redundant. I am looking for something more portable but I won’t deny the tablet itself was wonderful to draw with!","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I am one to read reviews and check out what is being said about a product I buy. I was looking at iPad Pro and surface pro by Microsoft. I watched YouTube videos asked people I know with the products and decided on iPad. I got affinity designer and procreate right after because I am an artist and wanted to see how iPad handled for art. AMAZING THAT’S HOW😀. I was afraid because iPad only has 4g ram and less ( PC user) but iPad is amazing. I guess with the 12x processor chip some how make up for ram. I don’t know how it works but it does. I have 2 windows up with procreate and it runs smoothly. I went over to apple store and bought the 2 year insurance for $129 which allows for 2  accidents like dropping, breaking screen etc.  So just saying love this product and hope this review helps someone else😀","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Bought this for school and learning piano. I use a couple different piano apps to teach myself how to play. It has a great microphone for that.Also like to watch movies while I work. Obviously it’s an iPad so it does all the stuff you’re looking for very well.64GB of space is more than enough for the average user. If you are planning on running a business I would upgrade to larger, otherwise I would just stick to the 64.I’ve downloaded multiple apps and my pictures and music and still have about 48GB free.The only downside to this is the Apple Pencil is sold separate. Not a huge thing but annoying. Also the USB C plug is a new feature that sucks when you have your house outfitted with the old plugs.Overall, 9/10 for the product. Very fast, the large screen is incredible and beautiful, Apple Pencil is great to have and helps with note taking for class or for coloring or other tasks.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"The Ipad came as expected no problems with shipping or anything like that but I am extremely disappointed with the Ipad itself.  It is very slow.  I bought it to use for college and in class, the students with computers are always so much faster than I am when we are all inputing data in google doc.  Huge lag time between loading a website and being able to cut paste information from the website to the google doc.  I found myself sitting there waiting to be able to get the screen after touching it both with my finger and the mouse I purchased to even be able to begin copying it.  Then when I flipped over to the google doc, I had to sit there and wait (more lag time) to paste it into the google doc.  We have an old Macbook at home that's like 10 years old and it loads faster than the Ipad Pro.  Wish I could return it but bought it before Christmas and didn't really use it until after classes started this week.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I now use my phone as a hotspot instead when I have no WiFi. Could not be happier with it. All apps open far faster with this version. The CPU is a beast. Great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But I still think they make the best Ipad's out there, with models, sizes, and price points for everyone. I really love my 12.9"", and would purchase it again. Combined with an Apple Pencil and a nice leather cover from Pad & Quill and you'll have the nicest Ipad in the room. I enjoy sitting and taking notes writing with my pencil. And the video is amazing.

"This is a must have tool for artists, the apple pencil is so precise you forget you are drawing on a screen, I got it, because I draw anime and manga and I prefer a digital tablet rather than pencil and paper, after you try this, you will forget about drawing on paper, digital is the only way to go.... IMO  If you are an artist buy it, if you are not an artist.. keep the 10.5 older version, there is really no difference... between the newer 10.5 and the older other than the missing home button... but the 12.9 is a definite upgrade... the apple pencil version2 is also more precise and more comfortable to hold and draw with, charges quickly and attaches easily with an internal  magnet.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Really good product. I am an artist and had been looking for a really good quality, (relatively) cheap tablet to get back into digital drawing. I settled on the IPad, rather than something like Wacom, for the price range. I bought the Apple Pencil as well and using it on the IPad is a breeze. It works just like using a pencil on paper and I can vary the strength of my lines exactly the same way. The touch screen is very responsive to either finger touch or the Apple pencil.The only complaint I have is that the tablet was quite a bit bigger and a bit heavier than I was expecting and that is on me. Because of the weight and size, it makes it difficult to just hold the IPad and draw. I have to use a table or other flat surface. However, as I mentioned, that is on me and not the product. Otherwise, I really like the size of the tablet for drawing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"So i order the 512gb but got a 64gb. So i decided to get a replacement for that one, but got another 64gb and then i order another replacement and got another 64gb. Not sure whats going on but feel like they don't have any","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Apple certainly did a great job with this ipad series. I think they are really starting to grasp what this product line should be all be it nearly 10 years later. I strongly recommend this Ipad if you are gonna be using it for these purposes.Note TakingDrawingProductivity i.e. MS office (word, excel, powerpoint, etc), light video and music production.Browsing the web and video content consumptionProgramming on the goIf  you can justify the price for what you are gonna do with the Ipad I doubt you will regret your purchase. Its the best tablet in the market right now and will become more capable as Apple releases new software features through updates. The only con here is the battery life which is rather low as mine lasts barely 5 hours right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"It started out fine. I would say the screen was great. I bought the pencil at the same time and have to say very happy with the pencil in the app procreate. Overall the tablet is fast and responsive and could play any mobile games on high graphics with no issue.That aside something went wrong. I work in a lab so we are classified as essential workers. We have all been doing very long hours, so I haven't had time to really play with the tablet and I don't even know when the marks showed up. It was sitting on a desk next to a desktop.  But the screen looks almost melted in spots. I was pretty much like wtf, and sent it in for repairs after talking to someone on the support chat.It got received and now they say:""Update your repair.Our technicians carefully inspected your product and found an issue that wasn’t mentioned in the original repair request. You can find more information on your repair listed to the right.If you wish to proceed with the repair, please approve the updated repair cost listed below. We can also send your device back to you unrepaired at no charge.There is damage to the display that is not covered by Apple's Limited Warranty, an AppleCare plan, consumer law, or the original quoted cost of the repair.""I tried calling and couldn't get through, so I opened a support text chat and she couldn't tell me anything and couldn't get anyone that I could talk to. She couldn't even tell me about what the technicians must have reported. They don't seem to have good ways for their staff to actually help people. If you are going to imply it was my doing you better tell me how I accomplished it at the very least.I cannot for the life of me think of anything that is in my house that could damage the glass in such a way. Especially when I wasn't even home. Looks like I either have to pay almost half of what the product originally was to get it fixed ($640+tax) on a tablet that isn't even a year old or just take the L. Now I have a useless apple pencil. I honestly recommend the tablet when it works but if this happens you are not going to get help for it. Which is a major turn off for me and probably a lot of people. I should have never gotten an apple product but while I love my wacom tablets they are not portable. But this was such a waste of money.Think long and hard if you want to risk getting one.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"As a professional artist who has been using the 9’7 inch 2015 iPad Pro with Apple pencil for four years, this was a big upgrade.I was originally concerned about upgrading because of the reports late 2018 early 2019 about “bent” iPads coming straight out of the box. However, I took the risk and I’m glad I did.The iPad was NOT bent, despite me purchasing the cellular model (which was thought to be more common for bends due to production process) and it arrived in all its glory.The bigger screen is perfect for anyone in animation or art industries, but if you’re looking to get an iPad for entertainment purposes such as Netflix and social media, I’d suggest save your money and aim for the smaller one.Overall, it’s a great purchase and I’m very happy with mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I have owned an original iPad Air, a first generation iPad Pro 12.9, and an iPad Pro 10.5. This is the best iPad I have ever owned by a significant amount.Face ID works flawlessly for me and is a game changer for opening the iPad. It is quick, simple and effective. And it gets better with use. It works for me in all lighting conditions, whether I have my glasses on or not and from multiple angles and distances. The only time it fails is if I am blocking the front camera with my fingers, and it nicely tells me of the problem.The performance is phenomenal. Particularly the smooth scrolling is an upgrade from my 10.5 iPad Pro. I use the tablet 4-5 times a week to run Zwift, which is graphic intensive and the iPad performs flawlessly. For using Zwift, the bigger screen is a nice upgrade for me. Thermally, my iPad Pro 10.5 got pretty warm running Zwift, but this one does not.The bigger screen and improved performance also make running Screens and Jump Desktop to access my Mac remotely a lot better. It is really almost like being at my Mac's keyboard.The USB C connector is another big upgrade. I have used a USB C to Display Port adapter (from Apple) to connect this iPad to a 4k monitor. Compared to using an HDMI adapter to do this with my iPad 10.5, there is no distracting display lag when using a mouse in iPadOS and the display quality is also better.Although this unit cost me $1,050 including the Apple Smart Keyboard Folio, it was well worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought this primarily for drawing/design work and I absolutely love it! It does a lot and will only do more when iPad OS is released. I love literally everything about this product.I have looked into getting Wacom drawing products where you can draw right on the screen and they all look clunky compared to this and require connection to a separate computer for use. To buy a Wacom product that has a computer built in costs three times the cost of the iPad Pro.I have done multiple art pieces on this and love using it with the Apple Pencil. It is the artist tool I have been looking for!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I resisted going for the apple ipad for a long time. As a PC and wacom fangirl I have long snubbed apple products as overpriced and not powerful enough for robust applications. But since my wacom is old as dirt and I was tired of being tied to my work station I was looking to upgrade. Wacom products are stupid expensive in comparison to this ipad so I decided to give it a shot.My goodness I am so happy I purchased this product, I really couldn't love and appreciate it more. I was a little disappointed finding out that a full form Photoshop was not actually coming to IPAD ( only a lite version) since I almost exclusively use Photoshop at the time of purchase.....but between clip studio paint and procreate for ipad ( and hopefully more apps in the future) I have really come around to using the ipad for my day to day drawing ( though sometimes I still need to take files to PS in order to use PS features not available on the procreate....like no gradients in procreate)All in all this product is so amazingly light and portable that I really feel way more free, and more capable of acting on my moments of artistic inspiration when I am out and about then before. Now that I don't feel tethered to my desktop computer  I think I am more productive.  This ipad is responsive, beautifully designed, intuitive to use, and the pencil+pressure sensitivity is top notch.I bought the ""paperlike"" screen protector because I personally do not like using the apple pencil on the smooth glass screen and not feeling any tactile Resistance.Positives: ridiculously lightweight and intuitive, beautiful designed, and  excellent responsiveness. Screen is a great size for artists.Cons: Fragile due to lightweight build, but I bought mine and put it in a case immediately so there has been no warping or bending despite everyday use. A case is necessary. This version might be a little too big for casual user, meaning if you want this device primarily for watching videos and not art/work  then it is a little too big.I'm so happy I bought this, no regrets despite the price. I may not be a fan of all apple products or price points...but this item is a big win.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought this (12.9” 256gb) as an artist, not as a casual consumer - and I’ve entirely replaced my Wacom devices with this big boi now.I was a little hesitant when buying and during shipping but as soon as I started drawing in Clip Studio and Procreate I was instantly sold. This is hands down the best experience on the market for digital drawing. It feels so crisp and clean.I use a tempered glass screen protector but a lot of artists swear by matte covers - don’t be swayed if it’s not your thing. Matte SEVERELY hinders your visual quality on the tablet. I work professionally as an artist and have zero issues working on tempered glass and I get to stare at that beautiful Retina display all day long, love it to pieces.Apple has really stepped up their game with this product and I’m honestly very impressed. As long as they don’t do anything dumb like trying to sell a monitor stand for $999 they’re in great shape. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I use this item mostly for my own learning. Just like you see on the online tutorials, I open 1/2 the page o Goodnotes and the other half to either my online course content or my text book and take notes! Its great. I do wish I could use a full-scale Word (not 365 or Google Docs) but it's a great tool for just that. The Apple Pencil works great for fine note taking and diagram drawing. The Logitech slim folio keyboard works perfectly (one tiny known bugaboo is that it doesn't tilt the iPad and the best angles but that's easily addressed with anything you might have).","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Package arrived on time and undamaged.  This gen 3 is so much faster than my older gen 1!  I sure do miss the button though since it’s a pain to swipe diagonally on the screen to close an app.  It seems like the screen is the same size but the border is gone which had that button!  3/4 of an inch smaller but I want the button back!!!  GIMME THE DANG BUTTON BACK!!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I had the 9.7” iPad Pro when my daughter broke my mini.  All of my iPads are cellular including this one.  I am an artist and I love the larger screen, which enables me to draw “big”.  It’s possible on others as well, but much easier on this.  Face ID works at any angle.  The screen is where I fall out.  My last iPad didn’t have a screen protector for two years and no damage.  I had this one for less than two weeks and have small cracks all over the bottom from the same pressure I put on my previous iPad Pro.  I love the usb-c charging port and adapters for it.  It provides better accessories because it’s going to be the new universal standard.  I love this and the magnetic way to charge the pencil is better than the previous version as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought this cuz I heard the full photoshop for iPad would be released soon. I also didn't want to buy a new high resolution monitor to replace a perfectly good monitor. My photos from my Nikon Z6 look great on this iPad. It also handles 4K video with no problems, where my laptop, which works great for most thing I need it for, was struggling with 4K videos. I don’t use it as a laptop replacement, though for a lot of people it could fill that job with no problems. The pencil I got for it is really worth it also, it’s not like a magical device, but it is very handy and useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I specifically got this to replace my phone. This device is a data only device. Having it say ""Wifi+Cellular"" is misleading. It will only let you use cellular for internet only. Do not expect to send calls or messages through SMS, and you will need to get a new number and use a text/msg app. This thing is great, but the whole reason to get this thing was to completely replace my phone. I will never recommend thing thing to anyone. Don't say your device is cellular if it doesn't have cellular capabilities!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is my 5th iPad and my 2nd iPad Pro.  That sounds like a lot of tablets but since Apple offers so much new technology, it almost requires constant updates.  I had the first version and it was game changing.  Then there was the Air which was so much lighter.  When they first offered this largest size in the Pro, I bought one.  With this current version, you still get the same large screen but in a smaller footprint.Of course, the newest is my favorite.  The processor is much faster.  The screen quality is the best yet.  The camera is the best yet.  What’s not to like?  Will they replace it with something better?  Of course, but why wait.  I will enjoy this one until the next best thing comes out.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"So anyone who knows Apple knows they are pricy, but trust me when I say you get exactly what you pay for. I had no issues with shipping, not even the box was damaged upon arrival. The screen has insane resolution, and the applications used by professionals are very cheap, I guess it makes up for the initial price of the product.Let me give just a bit of background. I have been using multiple types of media for years now, ranging from pencil, to watercolor, to pastel, oil... you name it. As a next step, I purchased the iPad Pro along with an Apple Pencil, and after getting a 10$ app called procreate, I can say ALL of the skill I have developed through traditional media translates directly into this. Unfortunately I can only speak as and artist, and I don't know about the quality of the music/professional/buisiness apps, but if you are wanting to upgrade your art arsenal, I would recommend this IPad every day of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I like the big screen and power for gaming but beware if you game on it and hold it from the corners your hand will start hurting cause it stabs it, and i mean one game of PUBG and it was hurting enough to not wanna play it. You can get one of those latch on controllers for it tho but i suggest iPad mini for gaming cause its way lighter and just because the pro is only 1.5 pounds the size of it makes it more difficult to hold, i have the regular iPad which is 1.8 pounds and you can hold that all day...

"I see more and more people abandoning paper notebooks and using iPads to take lecture notes, so I decided that it's time for me to do the same (I am a researches and I use it for work). No regrets! It's really convenient, and I even use digital notes to do calculations ""by hand"" -- those that I would normally do on a regular paper.The touch screen is a bit too sensitive, and I wish I were able to just rest my hand on the screen while writing notes -- just like with your regular paper (I do it anyways, but sometimes it causes glitches).I also use it for other purposes: basically, it often replaces a laptop for me. I especially like that there are a lot of high quality apps for musicians (my hobby :)).Unfortunately, though, it's a greedy Apple's product, so don't expect too many free apps in the store.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"If you are looking for a tool to support your everyday computer needs and artist expression look no further.  I researched and purchased this iPAD for my 19 year old daughter.  I admit we are primarily an Apple tech centered family. We all know Apple is premium priced and as a parent definitely a nose bleed especially having raised 5 kids (2 teens still at home and 1 at college).  I was able to compared this 12.9 iPAD pro against my 4 year old Apple Air 2 and now my new iPAD 11 pro.  I would have to say for my daughter the iPAD 12.9 is the perfect tool.  As a professional social networker 😀 and artist it combines a quality tool for both her needs. I won’t outline all the details here since you can read them in other reviews but will highlight one, quality!  Both the iPAD Pros 12.9 and 11 run the same hardware, software and Face id user interface.  I have discovered over the years to make sure I am happy with a product rather than regretting I really preferred one over another. Once I use the best I can’t go back. I would honestly have to say this is the best iPAD to date I have used.  For some of us purchasing APPLE products now days is a requirement that comes with fatherhood.  No doubt a big chunk of change, but considering the longevity and my past experience with Apple iPADs and products, I estimate a good 4-5 year success rate on this item.  I purchased an iPAD Pro 11 for myself mainly because the size was a better fit for my needs ( and my 16 yr old son wanted my iPAD Air 2 ).  There are absolutely no regrets on purchasing these iPAD Pro products, no, not even the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I’m an Apple’s fan. But I have to tell my truth. I was expecting to watch videos/movies with better resolution than in my iPhone.

Works fantastic for drawing especially with Procreate, the Paperlike matte protector and the ZUGU case. After stopping in Best Buy I'm so glad I got the bigger 12.9 rather than the 11 inch! If you are an artist get the 12.9! If you are a student or traveling a lot I would get the 11 inch. I love that I can draw and work but also watch Netflix and answer emails!

Needed to upgrade because the previous ipad version would no longer accept OS  upgrades and the other  associated  software support to maintain  security.  Transitioning from the previous 8 year old version was a snap.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This has honestly changed my life is so amazing I love it. I have no need for a laptop this works fine for everyday needs and any activity’s that cause for me to get online. I have personally equipped mines with the 2nd gen Apple Pencil and Logitech’s slim folio keyboard really giving my iPad the laptop feel without breaking the bank. I’ve had mines for about 4 months I have yet to experience any lag or technical issues. It’s just an all around amazing product","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"If you have a Macbook Pro / Air, iPhone, etc., do you really need the iPad? For us, this was more of an indulgence purchase. We don't really need it, nor do we often use it. It is nice to have around though, and it's fun to play with. Buy all means get one if you'd like, but you're better off if you have a specific use for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Bought mainly to substitute for my aging windows-based laptop. The iPad is working flawlessly so far. I’ve transferred most of my needed files over. The iPad starts instantly without warmups and annoying notices for updates. Thus, I’m using it more often than with the laptop.  Buying through Amazon also allows for multiple payments without interest.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"for most tasks where an iPad works, this is overkill. Hard to notice the horsepower this thing has. That said, I like overkill.I bought it to use as a desktop replacement with the iPadOS improvements. Maybe not quite there yet. Mouse interface is quirky.

Being able to have the app open at the same time as the training couldn’t be done on any other tablet in this same way. The colors are mind blowing and Apple Pencil takes it to another level.

"Went from a 4th gen. iPad to this bad boy. Beautiful screen resolution. Very thin, lite and powerful. Do yourself a favor and get a good protective case to protect your investment.

It will add to the weight but will be worth it in the long run, especially if you have small children using it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
