"Pros:__________- Super slim and super light. You can blindfold yourself and you wouldn’t know if you were holding an iPad pro or this tablet. No plastic, just metal, and glass.- Round corners, no sharp edges, making it more as an IPad Pro feel. Overall, high-quality look and feel are defiantly showing.- 10.5” AMOLED screen is a 2560x1600 resolution that shows where your money is going to. You can’t really explain it unless you see it.- Took it outside on a clear sunny day and the image quality is still superb in direct sunlight. The Ambient light sensors do their job in adapting to a sunny day to a dark room.- The deep blacks are excellent, and I love that you can tweak the saturation and white balance.  You’ll be surprised that many Android tablets will not allow you to do that.- Touch response shows not glitches, delay, or hiccups.- The speakers are the best so far that I’ve heard from a Samsung tablet in a long.  I would have to compare it to the 2018 IPad Pro. Extremely loud, great base, and an overall shock on how good they are as you can see the vibration coming out of the tablet (might be a Con but you’re never going to put it up that loud.)- Any day performance will 100% work.  Web browsing, movies, etc. A quick and snappy performance- Was really impress of the wireless performance and in range. I never got below 100Mbps at my location (2 story house, one wireless router- no extensions).-  Surprisingly I found the desktop mode very productive. Running multiple apps in windows it made multitasking very effective. I’m not a fan of multitasking on a tablet but if you Bluetooth a keyboard and a mouse, you have a pretty decent laptop. This feature I believe is called the DeX mode.- Playing Netflix for one hour I lost around 7% of battery life.  It was playing at 1080p and on 80% brightness.- Overall battery life is really good. I got two days, close to 11 hours of web, tablet gaming (medium power consumption) and Netflix. This is a pretty good steal given that some higher tablets need to be charged by the end of the day.-  A wise decision that they made the power button and the Fingerprint reader the same. Yes, the scan is fast, no complaints.- Type-C USB 3.1 Gen1. This means it’s fast charging.- Found no difficulty in holding the tablet as my hand position never covered the speaker grills.- The Bixby assistant feature is just like a Suri. Had it in a loud/crowded room and Bixby picked up my voice. The field microphone will make this tablet become a google home in theory. I think this feature will be great if your hand are full.- A minimalist design that follows the saying “less is more.”Cons and Oks:__________- It’s thin. I love this but without a case, this tablet will bend.  I wouldn’t even trust it in my backpack without a case. You will be on high alert if you sit on it so you need a case of some sort.- No HDR support which makes no sense since the display supports HDR.- No headphone jack. This is not a phone, it’s a tablet and the best sound quality comes from wired headphones.- This is an issue when you start doing “major” multitasking.  The result is that the tablet slows down.  You should always need maybe 2GB of free space but sadly the additional 4GB will not cut for deep multitasking (Get the upgraded RAM, if possible,  if you’re playing to use multitasking beyond the average person). This will apply to those who want to make this tablet their main form of a laptop, which I'm strongly against this idea.- No S-Pen support.  This doesn’t make sense.- Face unlocking is still in the testing phase in my eyes.  You can use it, but the finger scan is still the way.- Yes, there is bloatware.  You can never get away from it.- The camera is nothing to brag about.  I don’t even use it as any phone within the past two years can provide similar quality.- Android software overall has limited apps that support a tablet design.  I hope this changes in the future but expect a lot of apps opening up as if it was a phone app, but just expanded. You will get some pretty big black borders.- 0-100 I got a 2.30-time frame.-  Pretty cool that the back camera doesn’t stick out that much.- I playing ultra-high games (60fps) will make the tablet shutdown.  I played Legends on ultra-high and this issued occurred.  Put the graphics on medium and it was fine. Just an FYI.- Wish that added more screen as there is still a considerable amount more needless black border.  It’s still an improvement from last year.- I was told that Samsung will offer a $130. Kinda high in price for a keyboard case.Bottom Line:__________Samsung took a book out of Apple and followed the design method “less is better.”  It’s slim, light, and beautiful in image quality. The battery life is great and for the price, it beats paying an arm and a leg for an Apple tablet. I will say that of all the tablets out there, this one considers the closest of a laptop replacement (But not there yet). Apple’s 2018 IPad comes close, but some unique software options to make this a unique experience. Some hiccups are on this product but the pros out powers the cons here.Overall: First impressions, a premium experience without the ridiculous price tag. Still not a laptop replacement but an excellent tablet.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Pre ordered from Best Buy. Wont stay connected to wifi if being held sideways, therefore useless for gaming.  I'm not the only one with this problem either.  Samsung has a design flaw with wifi antenna placement.  Stay away from this tablet for now.Update:  received my second S5e yesterday, same problem.  I'm hearing from other people the same thing as well.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"For many years I had android phones and iPad tablets. It was time for me to just stick with one ecosystem, and when I saw the S5e, I figured I would give android tablets another shot.The first thing I noticed is the size: While having the same screen size as my iPad Pro 10.5, the Galaxy Tab is noticeably shorter, narrower, thinner, and lighter. It uses a wider aspect ratio on the screen (which has pros and cons), but for most movies and TV shows, than means the image you see on the Galaxy Tab will be larger than what you would see on the same size iPad due to it's more square-ish screen. (See my photo for size comparison -- the video is also about .6"" larger diagonally on the Galaxy Tab.)I spent a lot of time setting up the tablet just how I wanted, which for now kind of replicates an iPad. I chose the option to remove the app drawer and stuck with having folders of apps on my home screen. I then spent some time with the various apps I'm used to running on iOS along with apps that I normally ran on my phone. I have to say I am overall happy with the performance of the tablet. It is not quite as fluid as an iPad -- for example, when rotating the screen or opening app folders, the animation is occasionally ever so slightly jumpy rather than totally smooth. (I have the 128/6GB version, as I wanted the extra RAM.)The speakers are really good, and there is no headphone jack. I have to say, given how thin this tablet is, I just might buy the argument that one wouldn't fit inside. (But I'd still rather have one.) A PASSIVE USB-C headphone dongle is included. This means that the included dongle will not work on many other USB-C phones. On the other hand, an active adapter like the one from my Google Pixel 3 will still work on the Galaxy Tab.I am enjoying the screen -- it is bright and readable outdoors. It dims pretty low too, which is good for night reading.I'm not a big gamer, and so my various casual games have no problems running on the tablet.About the only issue I've been having is that I'm finding the fingerprint scanner/button a bit finicky. It's not clear to me the right way to turn on the tablet. Sometimes it seems like I need to press and hold, other times, just touch my finger to it, and other times it has trouble reading my finger on the first attempt. Some of this might be getting used to a very small/narrow reader, but it is a little annoying. At the time I wrote this, some other reviewers are saying there is a problem with the wifi when you hold the tablet sideways and cover the antenna with your hands. I could not recreate that issue on my device.So, I'm pretty pleased and I think this will let me finally ditch the iOS ecosystem (and lightning cables). My actual star rating would be 4.5.PS -- I do think a case is needed for this. It is very thin and, while it doesn't feel flimsy, some reinforcement is good. At the moment, Samsung's official (non-keyboard) case is a mind boggling $70 for a basic plastic folio case. I ordered one elsewhere, but I do think the official one looks good. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"May 17, 2019, edited 12/21/19 -- I promised I would give an updated review after I had owned the tablet for awhile:Honest Reviewer gave a VERY comprehensive review on April 26, 2019, so I will only add a few things.  Thin and light weight, easy to hold although I'd recommend a case of some kind for any tablet.  Screen is beautiful.  Speakers/sound is the best we've had in a tablet.  No headphone jack understandable to get this thin so you will need bluetooth enabled headphones or speakers for external audio.  Our Wi-Fi performance has been good, we have tried to duplicate the wi-fi issue reported by others that wi-fi reception varies with tablet orientation and have not been able to replicate the problem.  The default Samsung keyboard covered up a critical portion of one account sign in screen, if this happens to you I would recommend installing Gboard (the free Google keyboard) or Swiftkey ($), which allow vertical size adjustment of the keyboard, before setting up other apps -- you can always switch back to the Samsung keyboard later if you like it better.  Seven months in, no problems!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"PROS=====- Screen. Tablets are all about a screen. Period. And Everybody knows Samsung has the best screen in the world. LG also has good ones, btw.- An OK price point with a bundled deal. Probably will go even lower on Black Friday.- Performance. Very fast. It's such a joy when browsing the web etc.- Clean design and no company logo or any markings, at least on the front. They took about 10 years to finally realize that removing the Samsung logo is the way to go.- High quality speakers for a tablet.- Lightweight.CONS======- Wifi antenna position problem in horizontal mode. It's a well-known hardware design defect that's documented in the news articles and reviews. Look it up. No software fix possible. When I tested to see if it's actually true, the download speed dropped to almost 0.5 Mbps from 30 Mbps. Maybe not a big deal to some of you but you have to be mindful of it EVERYTIME you hold the tablet in horizontal mode. But how long mindful? Be mindful every single day for years until the device dies. That's another thing you'll need to keep it on your chest as a psychological burden. Returned back to Amazon. Of course, you can choose not to return it. And Samsung will think like, ""OK, we made a critical mistake but it still sells fine"". Teach them a lesson by returning your defective product if you're concerned, so they can take the high return rate as a wake up call. Otherwise, they will keep pushing out defective products.- ""You phone has restarted"". That's the message you see when you restart the *tablet*. Samsung probably missed it when they ported their Android software from their Galaxy phone to the tablet. It's a minor issue but you can see that Samsung is not run by a person like Steve Jobs and they don't pay attention to minor details like this. And it makes me wonder, ""If they missed this, what else did they miss under the hood?"" Something unthinkable for a big global corporation like them.- Performance. Slow when gaming as shown in other reviews probably due to their lower end graphics chip and the mid upper range CPU. I'm not a gamer therefore it wouldn't bother me though. Also, it's kind of expected for this price.- Camera bump. Who uses a high res camera on a tablet? It causes a camera bump. It's a problem if you're anti-camera bump. Again, they took about 10 years to finally realize that removing the Samsung logo from the front is the way to go. I'll give them another 10 years to finally remove the camera bump.- Documentation. Looks like it was written by some Korean engineer, which is fine. But don't they have it proofread before publishing it? Again, something unthinkable for a big global corporation like them. They should have a documentation department with native speakers for the language.SUGGESTIONS TO MANUFACTURER==============================- Use pure stock Android or Android One and stop wasting time and energy customizing it and publishing your half-baked software. Bixby sucks, for example. How many web articles do you see about tutorials on how to remove the Bixby button? People don't want it. Focus on what you do best -- hardware. Shift your energy and capital away from software.- Test well. Both software and hardware. The wifi antenna problem would have been easily caught by some basic testing. But it looks like the test engineers missed it. But how? They don't give their 100% when they are not treated well.- Lower camera specs so you can get rid of the camera bump, which will lower the price even more. Again, who uses a camera on a tablet? Of course you sometimes need it for a video chat but you don't typically need a high resolution one. Actually, a lower res camera is even better because you don't want to drop too many real-time UDP audio/video packets due to the bandwidth consumption by high resolution camera.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Primo tablet! I held on to my Galaxy Tab S 10.5 (T800)  because the screen, it spoiled me. Samsung came to their senses and brought back the superb screen and they didn't rest on their laurels. The speakers are amazingly loud and the sound quality is suprising. I don't know what is more impressive, the incredible battery life or how thin and light the Tab s5e is. It's so small with the ultra thin bezel. And the face recognition unlocks it quickly. It is very fast (I got the 128gb w 6mb ram) If you are unsure about moving to a new tablet buy it with confidence. I could not be happier. The only downside I can find is the lack of custom cases available. And no dedicated audio Jack, who cares I always use bluetooth:0)","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"EDITED 3 May 2019:So you've probably been reading in the news about the wifi problems when holding this tablet horizontally. If your hand covers the bottom left corner of the tablet, you can experience wifi degradation. Personally, when I tried to duplicate this, I saw one or two of the wifi bars ""disappear,"" but I never completely lost the signal. Can Samsung fix with a software update? Probably not.Is this a deal-breaker for me? Right now, no. Only because I mostly hold this tablet in the middle when holding horizontally. Also, I use a tablet ""pillow"" to prop this tablet up. And the games I play don't require me to hold this tablet with both hands. When reading, I hold vertically.Amazon offers 30-day returns, so I can always change my mind in 23 days.------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have tried again and again to use Apple because their tablets are so thin and light. But I just can't get used to not being able to customize my tablet with widgets. Thank god Samsung finally decided to make a thin and light tablet!!!!!!! That's the 1st thing you notice about this tablet! It can be held in one hand!Likes:- Thin and light- Speakers sound great- Screen: SUPERB! Great for reading Manga in my opinion...- Available in a 6GB/128GB version- Love the ''gold'' color...(looks like ''rose gold'' to me).Dislikes:- Feels a little awkward when reading epubs (cause it's a bit too big for that).- Not enough accessories available yet.Honestly, if I wanted a keyboard and pen, I would've bought the Tab S4, but I already have a ZAGG keyboard that I can use with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I really can't believe this made it to market with this wifi flaw. If you hold it in landscape mode, your hand on the bottom, you will cover the wifi antenna. If you are not sitting on top of your wireless router or access point, you will probably lose connection. This has been acknowledged by Samsung. What they will do about it is yet to be seen. I LOVE Samsung products. I have a phone and several older galaxy tab models. I wanted the s5e to be great. It was SO close. I like everything else about it. But the wifi problem runs it all. Not sure if I will wait a bit to see what they do or just send it back to Amazon. I would recommend you wait on this...","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"The new Tab S5e is a replacement for a 5-6 year old 8"" Samsung tablet that is now a bit long in the teeth and has significantly reduced battery life.For me these are the important features that make the Tab S5e the right unit for me.+ Excellent high-def screen. Videos look great on the device.+ Huge amount of storage. The 128 GB internal storage combined with a 512 GB micro SD card should be enough for a while.+ Long battery life. I expect 12 hours of video playback to be possible.+ Sufficient performance. I don't need a speed demon and the device is snappy.+ USB C. One of several reasons why I did not consider an iPad.+ Fast charge. Not so important to me but handy when you need it.+ Light and slim. Easy to hold and handle.+ Future proof with 6GB of memory.I am not crazy about the following though I was aware before ordering- Samsung crapware and eco-system. I hate their SW and BS services. This required a lot of tweaking to remove, disable or render invisible Samsung's software. Fortunately Nova Launcher simplifies this a bit.- I wish the unit had a 16:9 aspect ratio (instead of 16:10) and were about 1"" smaller. That would make holding it with one hand much easier and there'd be less wasted space with most videos.I have heard of the wifi antenna issue that others have reported but can't really replicate the issue. While the signal indicator varies quite a bit the connection has never dropped for me. Speedtest shows me about 250 mbps download speeds. However, I have strong wifi and I don't doubt that the issue is real in situations with weak wifi implementations or lots of wifi interference.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Upgrading from a 4-year old Nexus 9. Android on a tablet is such a better experience than ChromeOS. You get to use all the same apps in the same way as on your phone. All of this talk of ""no tablet support"" for Android is blown way, way out of proportion. All of the apps I use work perfectly in landscape, on a large screen.Now this tablet. First the 10,000lb gorilla in the room... wifi. There is definitely some truth to the rumors. To me, it just seemed like overall the wifi reception was bad, in all situations. On speed tests it does worse than my phone, however, I haven't really had problems with it getting the bandwidth it needs to stream video.Be warned this comes pre-loaded with apps hooking into every possible aspect of Samsung's ecosystem. And their ecosystem includes everything, and the kitchen sink. Most you can disable or hide. After that they don't get in the way.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

The speakers are amazingly loud and the sound quality is suprising. I don't know what is more impressive, the incredible battery life or how thin and light the Tab s5e is. It's so small with the ultra thin bezel. And the face recognition unlocks it quickly. It is very fast (I got the 128gb w 6mb ram) If you are unsure about moving to a new tablet buy it with confidence. I could not be happier. The only downside I can find is the lack of custom cases available. And no dedicated audio Jack, who cares I always use bluetooth:0)","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"EDITED 3 May 2019:So you've probably been reading in the news about the wifi problems when holding this tablet horizontally. If your hand covers the bottom left corner of the tablet, you can experience wifi degradation. Personally, when I tried to duplicate this, I saw one or two of the wifi bars ""disappear,"" but I never completely lost the signal. Can Samsung fix with a software update? Probably not.Is this a deal-breaker for me? Right now, no. Only because I mostly hold this tablet in the middle when holding horizontally. Also, I use a tablet ""pillow"" to prop this tablet up. And the games I play don't require me to hold this tablet with both hands. When reading, I hold vertically.Amazon offers 30-day returns, so I can always change my mind in 23 days.------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have tried again and again to use Apple because their tablets are so thin and light. But I just can't get used to not being able to customize my tablet with widgets. Thank god Samsung finally decided to make a thin and light tablet!!!!!!! That's the 1st thing you notice about this tablet! It can be held in one hand!Likes:- Thin and light- Speakers sound great- Screen: SUPERB! Great for reading Manga in my opinion...- Available in a 6GB/128GB version- Love the ''gold'' color...(looks like ''rose gold'' to me).Dislikes:- Feels a little awkward when reading epubs (cause it's a bit too big for that).- Not enough accessories available yet.Honestly, if I wanted a keyboard and pen, I would've bought the Tab S4, but I already have a ZAGG keyboard that I can use with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I really can't believe this made it to market with this wifi flaw. If you hold it in landscape mode, your hand on the bottom, you will cover the wifi antenna. If you are not sitting on top of your wireless router or access point, you will probably lose connection. This has been acknowledged by Samsung. What they will do about it is yet to be seen. I LOVE Samsung products. I have a phone and several older galaxy tab models. I wanted the s5e to be great. It was SO close. I like everything else about it. But the wifi problem runs it all. Not sure if I will wait a bit to see what they do or just send it back to Amazon. I would recommend you wait on this...","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"The new Tab S5e is a replacement for a 5-6 year old 8"" Samsung tablet that is now a bit long in the teeth and has significantly reduced battery life.For me these are the important features that make the Tab S5e the right unit for me.+ Excellent high-def screen. Videos look great on the device.+ Huge amount of storage. The 128 GB internal storage combined with a 512 GB micro SD card should be enough for a while.+ Long battery life. I expect 12 hours of video playback to be possible.+ Sufficient performance. I don't need a speed demon and the device is snappy.+ USB C. One of several reasons why I did not consider an iPad.+ Fast charge. Not so important to me but handy when you need it.+ Light and slim. Easy to hold and handle.+ Future proof with 6GB of memory.I am not crazy about the following though I was aware before ordering- Samsung crapware and eco-system. I hate their SW and BS services. This required a lot of tweaking to remove, disable or render invisible Samsung's software. Fortunately Nova Launcher simplifies this a bit.- I wish the unit had a 16:9 aspect ratio (instead of 16:10) and were about 1"" smaller. That would make holding it with one hand much easier and there'd be less wasted space with most videos.I have heard of the wifi antenna issue that others have reported but can't really replicate the issue. While the signal indicator varies quite a bit the connection has never dropped for me. Speedtest shows me about 250 mbps download speeds. However, I have strong wifi and I don't doubt that the issue is real in situations with weak wifi implementations or lots of wifi interference.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Upgrading from a 4-year old Nexus 9. Android on a tablet is such a better experience than ChromeOS. You get to use all the same apps in the same way as on your phone. All of this talk of ""no tablet support"" for Android is blown way, way out of proportion. All of the apps I use work perfectly in landscape, on a large screen.Now this tablet. First the 10,000lb gorilla in the room... wifi. There is definitely some truth to the rumors. To me, it just seemed like overall the wifi reception was bad, in all situations. On speed tests it does worse than my phone, however, I haven't really had problems with it getting the bandwidth it needs to stream video.Be warned this comes pre-loaded with apps hooking into every possible aspect of Samsung's ecosystem. And their ecosystem includes everything, and the kitchen sink. Most you can disable or hide. After that they don't get in the way.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought this tablet to replace my old Galaxy Tab A from 2015 I think. This thing is amazing in just about every way. I was a bit nervous going up to a 10"" from my old 8"" but it really is a much better size for movies games and general use. I highly recommend it bad check out the goods and the bads below.1. Screen is perfect2. Performance is great.4. The speakers (all 4 of them) sound superb5. Expandable storage6. USB-C (just a couple more USB devices and I can finally start getting rid of Micro USB cables)7. Latest version of Android is pre-installed and it so good.8. Battery life is on point, games will get you 4 hours or so depending on the game, movies I am not even sure its so good. General browsing, social updates, and email it will easily last ALL DAY.Now the bad's (there aren't many though""1. If you are holding it in Landscape mode with volume buttons on top and your hands cover the bottom corner the wireless goes to utter trash. While it is ridiculous Samsung missed this somehow, there is a simple fix which is to rotate it so the volume buttons are on the bottom (be better Samsung this is stupid) but not a deal breaker for me.2. The power button on the side is also a finger print scanner, super cool but because it is so thin if you dont place your finger just right it may not scan correctly.3. The Samsung keyboard folio cover (not included) connect the tablet with these net magnetic pins if the you move the screen around a bit while using you sometime have to readjust to get the tablet to recognize the keyboard again.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I'd like to complain about this defective product. After opening the box, it was noticed that the tablet screen was cracked near the charger connector and on the screen side. Then, I tried to charge the battery in order to test the device but it didn't work (The device didn't turn on). It is broken and defective.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Was having problems keeping WiFi connected on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e when I wasn't in the same room as the wireless router.  Other devices I have including the older Samsung Galaxy Tab 12.1 work fine in the same location.  Installed a WiFi signal strength analyzer and was able to see a significant drop in signal strength when my hand passed over the corner (like when in landscape mode and reaching with the left hand to change the volume).  The signal  strength would drop so low it lost the connection.  There is a definite flaw in the design of this that renders it unusable in most of my house when phones, laptop, and other tablets have no problem.  If I was right next to the WiFi router, the effect was not significant, but move to an adjacent room the problem occurs.  The problem was the same on both WiFi frequencies (2.4 GHz or 5GHz).I do NOT recommend this for purchase unless you are only going to use it in very close proximity to your router.  Although I loved the screen clarity, good sound quality/volume, and the light weight this had, it is unusable for practical use for me as a hand held tablet when it can't stay connected to the WiFi.  I am returning it.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I have mostly Apple and some Windows stuff, including a MS Surface Go tablet w/MS keyboard, and an iPad Pro 10.5"" with Apple keyboard.  I always wanted to try a Samsung tablet, but didn't want to spend a lot for an S6, so compromised with an S5e for a significantly lower price, but which still has great specs and terrific reviews.  I have to say I'm very, very impressed.  As an Apple guy, I seldom find products that match Apple's in quality - this clearly does.I like my Windows Surface Go - with its excellent Microsoft keyboard with embedded touchpad and mouse capability, it's the closest small tablet I have seen in approximating a desktop environment and usability.  However, the processor is decent but not extremely strong, and battery life is just OK.  I absolutely LOVE my iPad Pro as an entertainment and communication device, and it's extremely powerful, but it's awkward to use as a laptop replacement.  This Samsung does all of it well.  The keyboard doesn't have a touchpad, but you can easily add a bluetooth mouse, and in DEx mode, it's just like using a laptop - it may be Android based, but it's fast, slick, and runs all the critical stuff (MS Office, Chrome, my many home control apps,  email, etc).I added some pictures of the Surface Go, the iPad Pro (last gen., not the newest one), and the Samsung S5e in the middle.  I initially bought an aftermarket keyboard which I wasn't crazy about, and found the Samsung keyboard for this device at a local store on sale and have to say it's the best fit.  It clasps to the tablet in much the same way the iPad does with connectors, and doesn't require a bluetooth connection or charging.  Plus, the Samsung keyboard cover folds to a much slimmer profile than the aftermarket ones do.Screen quality - phenomenal - every bit as good as an iPad, maybe even better in terms of color saturation.  The Samsung device is noticeably smaller than an iPad Pro, but actually has more usable screen area due to its different aspect ratio and smaller bezels.  All three machines here actually have good retina-like screen quality, though the iPad and the Samsung are both brighter than the Surface Go.Sound - plenty loud and clear.  Four speakers.  Comparable to what an iPad offers.Battery life - haven't had this long enough to fully evaluate, but it's been booted up and on battery power for about 5 hours and is still at 71% charge with mixed use.  As good as or better than my iPad.  Seems excellent so far.  The Surface Go is the weakest of the three, probably lasting 5-6 hours on a full charge.  Have not had a chance to determine how well it holds a charge when off; Apple devices are typically outstanding.Interface - The Samsung in standard mode has a typical Android interface.  Not QUITE as slick as the iPad's, but close.  However, I fell in love with the DeX mode (first picture), which is as usable as any Windows or Mac desktop.  In fact, I had a small Logitech bluetooth mouse, and it installed easily and I can click around on the desktop like a regular laptop.  It's fast and responsive.  I plan on using mine in DeX mode 100% of the time.  You can customize the desktop and place icons on it just as in any desktop environment.  I downloaded MS Office, and Excel and Word open quickly and are completely usable - and with a mouse, it's much easier to use them, especially Excel, than it is on an iPad, despite the iPad Pro's stellar processor.Specs - This S5e is extremely thin, about as thin as an iPad, and much thinner than the S4.  Much thinner than the Surface Go, but about the same weight.  I got the 128GB version, which comes with 6 GB RAM.  Has a gorgeous, bright 2560x1600 screen.  The iPad Pro has 4GB for comparison.  Comes with adaptive brightness turned on by default, but you can turn it off.  Has a strong Qualcomm 670 processor which seems responsive and quick.  EVERYTHING responds and opens quickly.  The S6 tablet does have somewhat better specs, but I find the S5e completely satisfying in terms of speed, and this is coming from an iPad Pro.Storage - the base S5e comes with 64 GB on-board storage and 4 GB RAM.  The next level up comes with 128GB and 6 GB RAM., which is what mine has.  To get more base storage, you need to move to the S6.  It also has a slot that holds a micro SD card, behind a door on the side you have to pull off with a little pin (included), similar to the door that hides a SIM card on a phone.  So, the SD card is not visible at all when inserted, which is nice.  There is a ""My Files"" app that allows you to access and copy files.  I even transferred about 15 GB of files to the SD card on  this tablet with a USB-C drive from my Mac without issue.  It's a bit strange in that there's no ""Paste"" function; you ""Copy"" from one drive/folder and then ""Copy"" TO the target drive/folder.  When I had the external drive attached, the internal storage, SD card, and the external USB drive all showed up in the File  manager.You can also download and install a OneDrive app to allow access to your Microsoft files.  I installed it and it works well.  I also installed Google Drive with no issue.  There's a third-party iCloud app which I didn't try.  You can install apps from Google Play or the Samsung app store.Accessories - as stated, I got the Samsung keyboard, which seems to be a better fit and slimmer than the aftermarket keyboards, and allows connection via the connectors on the side of the tablet and therefore doesn't require a battery  powered, bluetooth connection.  I also got a capacitive stylus which doesn't require a battery like many of the pends out there.  I read the Samsung S-pen does NOT work with this device, so make sure you get a compatible pen.Security - this tablet allows you to set up access via a PIN, facial recognition, or fingerprint reader.  The Surface Go allows a PIN< password, or facial recognition (Windows Hello) but the iPad doesn't do facial recognition.  The iPad allows fingerprint authentication, but the Windows Surface Go doesn't.  The Samsung allows all of it.  In addition, there are numerous security features that will allow you to keep the screen unlocked if you have a trusted device nearby, or if you designate a trusted location, like your address.  Cool as heck and neither the Apple nor windows versions have that.  I will say the Samsung facial recognition doesn't work well when I have reading glasses on, and I have to remove them to use it - Windows Hello seems to work equally well whether I have glasses on or not.All in all, I am loving this thing,  For the price, it's an absolute bargain relative to its competition, and the quality feel and fit and finish are easily equal to any Apple product.  If you have a Samsung infrastructure but don't want to spend big bucks on an S6, get this - you won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"First off---I am NOT affiliated with Samsung whatsoever . I am a previous owner of the original Samsung Tab S 10.5  wifi model. I simply wanted this new highly upgraded Tab S 5e with all the new superior features and especially more RAM in this particular model---it doubled my previous Ram from 3 to 6 GB! This new baby BLAZES--- PERFORMS LIKE IT'S HAIR IS ON FIRE. I gave my original Tab S to someone who does not have much money-- a solid Samsung and still working wonderfully tablet. You'd have thought I had given him a new car, the way he reacted. I bought my brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab S 5e directly from Amazon...also I have included a little comparison vs the Apple iPad ( all iPad models not compared one by one here because of space.... yet you will pick up on my intent here )  ------The inutile iPad that can't even expand internal storage up to 1 TB forcing you to buy higher storage at obscene prices? The dumb iPad with Wifi only that doesn't even have a screen that comes remotely close to the gorgeous Super Amoled display in this 'half the price' Samsung tablet with LTE? ( compared to an iPad )... (An iPad with LTE costs insanely even more!) The jurassic iPad that doesn't even allow seamless file transfers and file sharing to and from Windows PC's and many other accessories, thumb drives, external store and peripheral devices? Many Apple buyers I speak with are proud of their overkill, (largely superfluous for 99% of tablet users) they brag about their ultrafast bionic processor equipped iPad, however, it doesn't even offer a superb multimedia experience with AKG tuned, Dolby Atmos sound quality from four, yes, that's f-o-u-r high quality speakers like the Tab S 5e has. The iPad you say that doesn't even allow the simplest of customizations and flexibility like the Samsung tab's DEX mode or an equivalent desktop mode with multiple windows open for true multitasking and productivity? An iPad that can't even wirelessly mirror its screen to smart TV's without resorting to a wired dongle or an overpriced Apple TV accessory? Please do more research next time. A super powerful processor that is locked up in a jurassic, restrictive and suffocating system called a 'walled garden' which actually is more like a walled prison is just that: Another Apple product meant for just bragging rights--primarily. With the younger people ( 18 to 35ish )....it's their peer groups that usually render the ""Apple Sway"" to buy Apple products...I have seen this many times Only 1% of iPad users actually do some productivity work on it, but still 99% of the time its for media consumption, which gives you a TRULY AND HONESTLY INFERIOR experience compared to this less expensive Samsung tablet that costs less than half the iPad Pro. ( The previous sentence most likely says it all when comparing Apple iPads vs this Samsung Tablet model....oh the pen??....surveys say those devises that come with the pen are once again are very rarely used be it Apple or Samsung..its a knee jerk ""gimmick addition"" to get you to buy it---to spend more $$$. Do NOT get it. The extra gadgetry newness of it wears off quickly.Once again in summation--- THIS TABLET is the best tablet right now.---in comparing everything.. Much better than the cheapest iPad Pro for half the price or even less than half. Loud, excellent quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, beautiful Amoled display, long battery life, accepts 1 TB micro sd cards, Widevine L1 certified so offline movie downloads get played at full HD. DEX mode is excellent too! Tablet allows both wired and wireless connections to smart TV. Just use DEX mode if you use wired connection for sending video out from Netflix offline download to TV so video doesn't get resized (common problem when device is at an aspect ratio other than the TV standard of 16:9). A word of warning for Google Play Movie users: For wireless mirroring of Google Play Movies, don't update the tablet's built in Google Play Movies app. The newest Google play movie app version disables wireless screen sharing and also disables wired screen sharing so that you will be forced to buy a Chromecast. If you have accidentally updated Google Play Movies app, just uninstall it and it should revert back to the older factory version. Disable auto update to avoid Playstore from updating automatically your Google Play Movies app and other apps. (You can manually update the other apps).","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Pros:I really like the tablet, mine works as intended. And is a great improvement over an older tab A 8in.Cons: However,  the supplied cord is unreasonably short. I can't plug it in anywhere in my house and have the tabel sit on a surface other than the floor. It's not even compatible with my USB tower. The battery drains faster while charging than it does not plugged in.  Samsung doesn't even have longer cords available for purchase.  I'm very annoyed at risking the safety of my tablet because a proper charging cord in a longer length isn't available for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought the Tab S5e and so far I am loving it. The screen is amazing at a 2560x1600 resolution so its great for media consumption. The screen also gets very bright I never have it at full brightness. Battery life is amazing. I typically get around 9-10 hours of screen on time at 80-90% brightness. 2 issues most people have with this tablet is the snapdragon 670 processor and the wifi connectivity dropping when you hold it a certain way. I can tell you that the tab S5e is very quick and snappy. I have the 128 gb of storage with 6 gb of ram version (which I recommend getting). The wifi connectivity issue only happens when you cup the top left corner of the display when you hold it in portrait mode and it only slightly drops for me. I typically have the tablet sitting on my lap, desk or holding it in landscape mode on the edges in the middle. So the wifi dropping is not an issue with me and I don't think it is an issue with most people. overall this is probably the best tablet to get for the price if you are using it for media consumption, web browsing, and some word documents. I highly recommend this tablet","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Amazing tablet.  Screen is drop dead gorgeous.  Super light. Great sound from the 4 speakers.I have zero wifi issues.  Been using it for 4 days now and no dropouts or dissconnects when holding the tablet on the lower left side.  Could possibly be just a silly rumor set up by Apple loyalists who cant fathom Samsung making a superior/cheaper product.I definitely reccomend buying this tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This tablet froze on me after 3rd day. Not because it's hot in my place( Seattle area btw), when I hit the back from the screen it froze and tried to press power button it would turn off. Never had an experience with my Samsung tab 10.1","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I have two units of the Tab 5Se. Both of them has issues on touch sensitivity.  Sometimes,  I have to press the screen up to 5X for it to respond.  This is PAINFUL! It's like the old capacitive screen technology. Not acceptable.The rest, is okay,  including the sound.BOTTOM LINE. This is a piece of CRAP !SIDE NOTE. I have two of the galaxy TAb S2 9.8"" that did not have type of problem. But I wanted to replace it because of the screen size/ dimensions.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"First off, I have very different needs from most folks. I do comically little recreational content consumption. I need a tablet for scholarly papers, software documentation, and light remote system administration work. I had to grudgingly upgrade as my current Tab S2's battery life was getting down to just a few hours.A quick review for folks who just want content consumption (nerds, feel free to skip this and read on below:This tablet is very likely what you've been looking for. The display is absolutely gorgeous and battery life is solid. The expandable uSD slot has been phased out by most other companies, but it's thankfully still there. Something else to bear in mind: There is no headphone jack. I know that I'm in the minority on this one, but its absence doesn't bother me in the slightest. On my older tablet, the headphone jack is a magnet for dust, lint, and rust. I don't think I've ever used it and am happy that it's gone. There are no hardware buttons. The power button is slightly recessed and doubles as the fingerprint reader. The reader is extremely fast and naturally placed.Did I mention the bloatware? No? Because there isn't any to speak of! For clarity's sake, my definition of ""bloatware"" is a preinstalled application that cannot be removed by the normal uninstall process. I'm told that they can be ""disabled"" but you're relying on the operating system to pinky-swear that it won't accidentally re-enable it (looking at you, Microsoft).Now, there is some preinstalled software. Spotify, Netflix, Microsoft Office Trial, various half-baked Samsung applications trying to compete with Google. Of these, only Netflix and a few Samsung applications which feel like they're an integral part of the operating system, are impossible to remove. Again, Samsung lets you remove a lot of its own applications! And not having Facebook and its data slurping ilk permanently installed? Huge, and some serious props are in order to the decision makers at Samsung.Warning: Here be nerdy dragonsOkay, nerds. Let's get to the nitty-gritty. This thing actually is perfectly usable out of the box. I know! With that said, I still believe that root access is important enough to warrant some tinkering. It took me about 2 hours to go from a stock system to a rooted one with a custom image.The bootloader is easy enough to unlock. You'll have to wipe the device and you'll from now on see a scary message on boot cycles, but that's a small price to pay. The tricky bit is that every boot cycle that you go through (at least in my tinkering) has to be done after an internet connection has been established and you still want to go into the developer settings and ensure that ""OEM Unlock"" is still visible and toggled. A few times I found myself in the dreaded, 7 day jail, where apparently Samsung thinks you need a 7 day cooldown period to make sure that you really really want to tinker with its software. I got around this by using an obscure hackers trick I like to call, changing the date on the calendar to 10 days prior.Installing TWRP in download mode was simple enough, from there everything should be familiar to any ROM hacker out there. I used an unsupported build of LineageOS. No complaints so far. I've been in a blissful state of a vanilla Android environment with system level ad-blocking and the ability to add new features (DLNA streaming, custom Bluetooth codecs, oddball filesystem mounting support, etc) at a whim.I long for an actual FOSS alternative to Android and iOS. But until then, this is a surprisingly hackable device. I really wanted to give 4 stars for the 7 day waiting period. But the absence of bloatware is such a huge feature it almost overrides everything else.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought this tablet to replace an aging and very worn original Galaxy Tab S.  I am NOT disappointed.  It's about the same size, is much faster and does what I need it to do.  I mostly use it for email, social media apps and a few games.  The S5e is lighter than the Tab S and the battery life is much better.  I was concerned with the lack of an audio jack, but the S5e came with an adapter cable that allows me to use my old style ear buds without having to purchase a Bluetooth set.  I'm very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"So I was vey happy becouse weight and design is very nice, but when I checked wifi connection, tablet looses it when I have it in my hands !! :@ so shame of Samsung ! What can I do now ? Is it technical problem or should I wait some new sistem updates to fix that problem ?","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I use my tablet mostly to read newspapers and books and to watch TV online when I am on vacation, which is much more comfortable when I can prop it up on something (a pillow, my stomach, or stand of some sort). Also the design of the cover I bought  (Infiland) will only prop it up in landscape and makes it very clumsy to hold in the hands in portrait mode.So it's very disappointing that this tablet at least half the time fails to rotate to landscape so I end up having to remove the cover to read in bed. Unfortunately I kept thinking I'd find the trick to make it work, so missed the return period, but for anyone who wants to read from it I don't recommend buying it.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"UPDATE #2:I was aware that the early 2019 models had a Wi-Fi  antenna glitch where as in certain up/down or left/right positions while handling/holding the tablet would cause the Wi-Fi to drop out or lose effect, i thought they would have fixed it wilh a firmware update or patch but the problem still exists.... I was told by Samsung that it was a hardware problem and the person immediately said ""like the I-pad had""-- I said so what is the fix and he said ""we are working on it that's all I know""-- I then responded by saying is it covered under warranty? And he said ""no' --then "" I don't know. I said which is it? he said ""I don't know""OK, so it does it a small amount of the time but it sill annoying and at this price, day and age in Wi-Fi this should not even be a problem... I will send a letter to Samsung that i expect them to fix this or replace this or i will make a civil claim against them...UPDATE: Regarding connecting this to a Samsung phone--Even though the Samsung descriptions says it will work with:ATT--VERIZON--T-MOBILE--SPRINTIt does say others phone carriers may ""Vary""What I was told is that there is a ""Compatibility and Continuity issue"" - SamsungAfter being persistent in pursuing the truth and a real reason on what ""vary"" means the ""Senior Samsung"" agent said ""it will not work with any carriers"" other than the for listed above... Samsung should just say that so that there is complete transparency so customer can choose wisely... Having said that --- I will keep the tablet and drop the rating by one star.INITIAL REVIEW-Very capable tablet-right up there with I-Pad Pro-- Samsung put the right things together to make this work well. I am still having some trouble getting this set up with my Samsung phone to take and receive message and calls, but I think it is a glitch in my own head... Remember when you would get a phone book size manual with computers? I purchased this also and it is big deal for me because of my eyes... It has the Super OMLED screen...It has a stunning and beautiful picture that looks like by new generation (2019) Samsung 4K UHD HDR up scaling smart TV... I almost think it has some up-scaling capabilities but they don't actually say that...I watch allot of YouTube- Prime Video-- Netflix late in the evening and it is a pleasure to look at... I am  a little dubious about their claim on 5 days for a charge, but then again am watch power hungry videos.... You will like this!","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I am really enjoying my 10"" Galaxy Tab S5e tablet.  I chose the rose gold back and was pleasantly surprised to find it very attractive indeed.  I ordered the 128 GB to give myself plenty of future space.  Before I unpacked it I waited for the Omotion tempered glass screen protectors, that I ordered with the tablet, to arrive so my new tablet could start out fresh with no fingerprints all over the screen.  Glad I did cause it turned out amazing.  Those are wonderful glass screen protectors and I am very pleased.  They are very clear and do not hamper the clarity of the screen in the least.  Very easy to install, with very clear instructions.  The tablet is wonderful.  I had no trouble loading on the apps I use and there does not seem to be any lag time in what I have used so far. The battery life is very good.  I read reviews complaining about the fact that there is no 3.5 headphone jack in the tablet, which made me do further research before I bought it. What I learned convinced me it would be OK.  And it is OK. It comes with a 3 & 3/4 inch dongle adapter that has a 3.5 connector on one end and a plug-in that attaches to the charging (multi-purpose) port on the other end. I just leave the dongle attached to my earbuds and it works very well. The only drawback might be that you wouldn't be able to charge the tablet and listen through earphones at the same time. I just keep it charged when I am not using it and have not had an issue with it so far.  I have used the tablet for online shopping at Amazon and other sites, and for watching movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime, and for reading eBooks and listening to audio books on Nook and Walmart eBooks, and I play a few simple games like 7 Little Words and Solitaire. Of course I have to also check out the weather report regularly.  I am having fun exploring the possibilities of new apps. So far it has responded admirably to every task I have asked of it.  I do recommend this tablet, and the shipping was really fast too, even before I signed up for Amazon Prime and their fast shipping promise. I am very satisfied with my S5e.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I switched over to the S5E from an ipad pro, which was old and having issues. I didn't want to throw down the money for a new one and figured I'd give the samsung a chance, since I love my S10E. My mistake. The screen is awkwardly elongated, but is actually an amazing screen. The battery life isn't half bad.The issue is with the touch sensitivity and lag. Now that this tablet is 6 days outside of the return period, it's laggy in responding to touch and sometimes requires me to repeatedly poke at the screen to get it to register. Now I'm stuck with this tablet that I hate. I should have gone with the ipad.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is my third Android tablet (after two Nexus 7 lasted longer than expected). It is difficult to move from pure Google hardware - I had also Nexus 5X phone - because each brand name comes with their own bloatware and Google replacements. But that was not so bad. Otherwise I am thrilled: speed, video, battery life and overall feel are excellent. The only problem I have is with sound dongle (unit comes without stereo jack) as it makes difficult to charge when used for long video-conference. But this is expected today - and bluetooth headphones solve the problem. I added to it USB-C dongle with external video and multiple USB connectors for keyboard and mouse, and I am happy without the need for a laptop.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Have had lots of Samsung phones, watches and tablets.  Very disappointed that this one kept crashing, out of the box.  Samsung tech support was useless, as usual.  You are always better off searching for answers in product community forums.  Unfortunately, no suggestions there helped with this Tab S5e","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"I recived my tablet today and so far, it's exactly what I wanted and expected. I'll update my review as I use the tablet.  I've used a Lenovo, a kindle fire and other Samsung tablets.Pretty excited!Edit June 1: great tablet! I have not experienced some of the Wi-Fi issues that have been reported.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I love the form factor and build quality of this unit. Those alone would overcome the bloatware, which is significant and immutable. but the reason I would advise you against purchasing one of these is that the Wi-Fi is really quite poor. The issues are not limited to a particular location on the unit. The Wi-Fi is way below usable in many situations. I have tried it on more than a dozen networks and it is consistently weak and prone to drop offs.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"The Galaxy Tab S5e has a Super AMOLED display that looks gorgeous with rich colors, excellent contrast, and deep blacks but problems start to appear almost as soon as you start using the tablet.  The display can't be calibrated (which was a feature on earlier Galaxy Tab models) and offers touch response that can be shockingly bad--while using basic everyday apps I sometimes needed to touch the display three or four times before a touch would register which is worse than the performance on a $100 budget tablet from Chuwi.I was then surprised to not experience that same touch response issue playing games. I downloaded two different screen test apps from the Play Store and the display operated perfectly with no touch response issues at all.  Samsung's Game Optimizing Service built into the OS most likely ramps up the power into performance mode so gameplay is smooth.  The display test apps are apparently treated just like games and get the same high-performance treatment which is touch response registers very differently in testing than during regular everyday use.Another issue that plagues the S5e display is a very pronounced jelly effect while scrolling within certain apps.  Complaints of a jelly effect when using Chrome instead of Samsung's own internet browser are widespread but I found one of the worst offenders to be the Samsung Member's App--the jelly effect was so bad I couldn't stand using the app and decided to completely uninstall it.There's also a known issue with internet connectivity being cut off when you hold the S5e by the corners in portrait mode because your hands block the antenna.  This design flaw was noticed by purchasers and reviewers almost immediately after the S5e shipped out and there's a warning about it on the Consumer Reports website.  It doesn't seem possible the S5e could have gone through testing without Samsung discovering the problem so the likely explanation is Samsung did know about the issue but decided to sell the S5e anyway.The display also has a lower-resolution than Samsung uses on many of their smartphones so if you want HDR certification for Netflix streaming you can forget about it--at best the display can play video at 1080p although many owners have reported 720p video streaming.  I don't see any way that watching a movie on a 10.5"" display at 720p isn't a lot more preferable to 4K HDR on a 6"" display but a lot of people are obsessed with hardware specs and will consider Netflix on the S5e inferior to watching it in 4K HDR on their smartphone.The biometric authentication on the S5e is also below average at best.  You get a very unreliable fingerprint scanner on the side of the tablet that also doubles as the power button.  Unless you are using a case with a cutout for the power button the fingerprint scanner can be difficult to locate by touch and it usually takes me 2 or 3 tries before my fingerprint is recognized.  There's also a useless face unlock option which might have actually worked three times in the first two weeks I've used the tablet.  It's so worthless I've found myself shocked whenever I didn't need to use the fingerprint scanner instead.  The S5e does at least have the normal Android smart lock options allowing you to keep the tablet unlocked at specific locations you choose (like at home--the location positioning isn't accurate enough to unlock only in your bedroom but not in the rest of your home) or when the tablet is connected to specific Bluetooth devices which reduces the need to rely on the tablet's poor biometrics.The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e is actually nice for watching videos from Netflix or Amazon Prime and for listening to music (the speakers sound great).  The ability to add a MicroSD card with up to 512GB of storage also gives you a lot of room for downloaded videos and music when you don't have access to reliable WiFi.  The WiFi problem on the S5e specifically affects faster 5GHz connections but when streaming video in landscape mode WIFI should be reliable.  This tablet is also pretty good for games.  Overall touch response also improved after a couple of weeks although I'm not entirely sure why.  There isn't a performance mode that can be enabled by a user but the OS includes power optomization that changes the power settings based on your usage.  It's possible the OS decided to give the display more juice which is why it eventually started working better.The S5e receives the terrible software support Samsung is notorious for.  Right now it's April but the S5e is still on the January security patch.  Currently, Samsung is focused on updates for their obscenely overpriced S20 series phones and higher-profile devices like the S10 series so it could be a long wait before the s5e receives another update and since Samsung has a new tablet coming out soon things will only get worse.Samsung makes mediocre phones priced much too high and that applies as well to this tablet.  With so many issues the current asking price of $479.99 for Galaxy Tab S5e is much too high.  I only recommend this tablet if you can find it for $200 or less.Update:This tablet has grown on me slightly, mainly because the touch response issues reduced (but never completely disappeared) over time but I still couldn't recommend the Galaxy TabS5e at this price point.The lack of an update to Android 10 for such a new product was an irritant at first but it has turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  The December Android 10 update for the Galaxy S10+ has been ludicrously buggy, making the $1,000 phone unstable and sometimes barely usable.  Despite an abundance of bug reports from owners nearly 5 months later there still hasn't been a single bug fix.  For this reason alone I would never buy another Samsung product.While it pains me very much to say this if you can't find a good alternative to Samsung when it comes to Android Tablets then I would recommend buying an iPad instead.Chuwi sells some budget tablets officially on Amazon complete with warranty but anything from their brand priced below $300 that I have used has been junk.  Chuwi makes some reasonably good quality tablets and laptops (although Xiaomi, Huawei, and even Telecast are all better choices) but Chuwi doesn't sell anything even halfway decent below the $300 price point.  Since Android tablets are a niche market in North America (they're a lot more popular in Asia) Samsung pretty much has the Android tablet market all to itself here unless you're willing to buy a Chinese tablet.  At around $200 less than Samsung's charges you can get an excellent Chinese tablet that's sleeker, snappier, and more innovative than anything from Samsung but low-cost Chinese tablets that seem to be fantastic bargains and sometimes even have impressive on paper specs are never good products in my experience so consider yourself warned.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"When we received this item it had what looked like a very small chip in the bottom left corner of the tablet.My wife was ready for a new tablet and as this was not a big deal we let it go.Now we have cracks along the bottom edge and across the bottom left corner of the tablet even though it has been in a case sense day one and never left the house.I would suggest people take a good look around before buying things like this on amazon.This is not my first high tech item to go bad but it will be the last I buy from a mail order.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Opened box, removed tablet. It’s really thin and light, so first thing I did was put into a case.Powered on tablet and set it up, there are a lot of settings for Samsung stuff.Set up finger prints, the power button fingerprint reader works well once you get used to it .I have the 128Gb model, so I have 6 Gb of RAM.I have been using this tablet for primarily streaming videos from amazon and Hulu. No problems with buffering or stuttering. Screen looks good, color saturation is good with none of the overblown cartoony colors of past Samsung devices.I have not experienced any of the WiFi death grip issues reported on the web. Maybe I’m just holding it right or it’s the case. Either way, solid network performance.Audio volume is a bit weedy like most Android devices, unless you turn on the Atmos setting. Don’t know if it is giving me any kind of surround sound but it does make the output louder through headphones. Since Android now includes LDAC (Sony’s Bluetooth protocol for better sounding audio) and I am using Sony headphones, Bluetooth audio sounds good and no issues with connection.I have tried split screen mode, watching a streaming video and surfing the web. Worked nicely.One side note. Google really doesn’t do much to support Tablets in Android. iOS apps will have a separate version for iPads, tailored for the tablet. Not so in Android.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"The keyboard and screen is better than the Google Pixel C that this replaced, online videos , MLB TV, Plex and YouTube all play great.Setup was easy, 15 minutes,  and you can actually migrate all your apps from your old android.I'm not sure about all the negative reviews, guess I'm lucky and got a good working new tablet.The reports about the wifi dropping is not entirely true, the signal drops by about 1 bar if you cover the left bottom corner,  but the wifi stays connected.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Been using this tablet for two weeks now. My second Samsung android tablet. Screen is beautiful. Performance, meaning Internet, running apps and everyday use is blazing fast. Things load faster than my Samsung i7 core laptop. I'm fully entrenched in the Apple eco system being an iPhone user for a decade. I prefer Galaxy tablets over iPad's because they are a great adjunct between the windows world and IOS. For half the cost, can't  beat it. Email, web surfing and other functions work great for my needs. Not quite a replacement for a laptop but close. I use this more than my laptop. Can't comment on gaming performance coz I'm not a gamer. I would imagine it performs well. Regarding complaints about wifi being dropped, haven't experienced that myself. Extremely satisfied with this tablet and would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"NO:  S-pen despite the manufacturer's comparison chart in the ad here on Amazon.NO: Jack for headphones > if you want to use headphones you must use the included USB-C to 3.5mm Headphone Adapter.  This was to keep the tablet thin.NO: USB C to USB C cable to transfer memory to this device.  There is a USB-A to USB-C cable, but if you wan't to transfer memory from another Samsung tablet or phone, you'll need either a USB-C to USB-C cable or you'll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter.  Samsung was too cheap to include the needed parts, nor did they explain what would be needed in the instructions.  Fortunately I was able to find the needed adapter in the box for my Galaxy S10 box, otherwise I would have been stuck.Very thin & light.  Quality build.Battery drains faster than expected.[I purchased the 64 GB]","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"After a good 5 years with my first gen Galaxy Tab S 10.5 I tried the Google Pixel C as a replacement and it was pretty good, but I had bought it right before it was discontinued and support was ended for Android updates (besides security patches), so I returned to Samsung to see what was new. I checked out the flagship Galaxy Tab S6 which was awesome but more than i needed. The Tab A was too cheap and i disliked the aspect ratio for the screen display. I had passed on the Tab S2, S3, and S4 primarily because they took away the 10.5"" display. When I saw the S5e I hadn't heard about it so after checking it out and finding its the mid-level tablet and it was the newest release from samsung (Holiday 2019) and was reasonably priced, I jumped at purchasing it. Performance is great from the Qualcomm Octacore processor, it has alot more storage than my old Tab S has, is fully featured with Super AMOLED Display, 10.5"" edge to edge display, adaptive fast charging capability (The old Tab S took all day to fully charge), compatibility with the S pen, and is super thin and even more lightweight than the Tab S was. Plus it features quad speakers tuned by AKG (just like the Galaxy S10 smartphone) and the latest Android OS as well. It is a smart choice for someone looking for something not quite flagship Tab S6, which is geared more toward a desktop replacement/productivity tablet, but something more than a cheaper no frills entry level tablet like the Tab A Series.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This tablet basically fulfills every need I have for a mid-sized tablet. For the price v value you can't beat it. The symmetry and design aesthetic is spot on. The speakers and screen are amazing. The thinness and weight is lighter than a phone. I'm loving this tablet. And despite the landscape wifi covering issue, I have no problems since this is primarily used in portrait mode. This was the tablet I've been waiting for, granted, I don't use or like Samsung devices, and can't stand OneUI used on them, however this is an exception simply because it's such a clean looking devices, and the specs for the price are unbeatable.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"For years, I have been using Amazon Kindles. A few months ago, I ""upgraded"" to a Kindle Fire HD 8. I think this Kindle is way too underpowered. It is slower than my previous Kindle Fire. I had been forced to frequently reboot to get anything done. I decided I'd had enough of low-priced tablets. I searched for a tablet in the $400 range and settled on the Samsung S5e. All I can say is why didn't I buy this sooner? I can't see me ever going back to a Kindle. The price tag for this tablet is not cheap. Given the preformance, I feel the cost was money very well spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"UPDATE: Upgrading from 2 stars to 3 because Dex while flawed is pretty cool.I've had the tablet for a few hours now. I gave the s5e 2 stars because for the money, in my case $455, I want more out of my tablet. For $300 I'd give it 4 stars. For $250 it is a 5 star tablet. Now this is still a good tablet. For the price I would not expect wifi problems or the lack of ability to play 4k hdr on YouTube and Netflix.Pros:The screen is gorgeous.The tablet is ultra thin and light.Once Dolby atmos is enabled the sound is really nice for a tablet.Moving around the os is quick and snappy.Fingerprint scanner is great.Cons:My 5se has the same issue that many people have had with the wifi greatly diminished holding the tablet in landscape mode with the hand on the bottom left side corner. With the book cover case I don't experience the issue. This is unacceptable for an entry level tablet much less an upper mid tier one.No hdr 4k for Netflix and YouTube.Bloatware. Don't force apps on me bro.No headphone jack. This isn't an issue for me as I plan on using my Bluetooth headphones.If the cons aren't an issue for you I doubt there's another android tablet that compares for the price in a dying market segment. I'm on the fence if I'll keep this. I'm leaning towards keeping it as mine came with the Samsung book case cover which I really like.","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"Bought this to replace an aging Samsung Galaxy Note 12.2. I wish they still made Android tablets with a 12 inch screen. Market forces apparently don't support the business. You either get a tiny screen, like this one, or go to a Windows 10 convertible. Sometimes Android is nice enough, and gets better battery life than Win10 ever will. Alas, we are left with mini tablets like the S5e. I don't like it, and probably shouldn't have bought it.The screen response on some apps is... weird. When watching Netflix, it's difficult to pause the movie; hitting and tapping and swiping the screen don't work all the time. Also, viewing Gmail on this tablet lacks finesse: the display jumps and jerks. Never seen this behavior before, only on this tablet.One more thing that I really hate is the orientation of the volume rocker. Hey Samsung, how about giving an option to reverse the volume control?","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"I was so excited to get this tablet I needed to replace my old Asus zenpad. It takes great pictures, has a good battery, and a decent screen. You might ask why did you give it only 2 stars. The reason is because they have terrible customer service who lied to me several times. They said the screen is HDR compatible but that's a lie, they said any USB-C to Ethernet adapter would work but that's a lie, and they said that there are no wifi problems but that's also a lie depending on how you hold the device you can lose 50% of your WiFi speed. If I knew this beforehand like I tried to I would have bought a different device like maybe the S4 but with the severe deception I'll never buy from Samsung again. Such a shame they have lowered their standards I never had a problem with any of my 3 previous Samsung devices.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

This maybe my internet connection.I would recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a device to surf the web and view media.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"This would be a five star tablet if two minor issues did not exist. In fact, with those fixed, the other excellently performing features would make it 10 stars.  So, it will do everything you could want from it other than 1) connects to weak wifi signals and 2) activate the screen controls at the bottom of the screen (show running apps, show app icon screen, and step back).  The wifi works, but it will slow down or lose connections much sooner than my umpteen year old S2 tablet as I move away from my access point.  The orientation of the S5e can be changed to get a stronger signal but that's a nuisance.  Thankfully,  wifi signals these days are usually strong enough for the tablet to function.  In my case, my office gets wifi through several walls and 40' so the signal is not very strong and sometimes requires me to re-orient the tablet to get full speed wifi.  The three screen controls at the bottom of the screen are slid upward with a finger to switch to the running apps or app icon screen or step back.  It often takes two tries for my finger to get them to work.  This might be something about me or how I'm operating them, but I haven't figured out what works best after several months of trying.  Complaints aside, I'm really enjoying this tablet.  Maybe the best feature is the 16x9 screen that shows TV style movies perfectly and is wide enough for modern ""wide-screen"" movies.  The color and brightness are great.  Battery life is phenomenal.  Much better than my old S2 though I thought it was impressive.UPDATEI got tired of the weak wifi problem so added a wifi access point in my office.  That access point some what covers the back yard making the S5e useful there.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"A proper gaming tablet has been my white whale. I've tried several times to pick the best of the best and came up short.I was skeptical of this tablet but after tons of research it came up as the best gaming tablet option.- Sound is phenominal, especially when you turn on dolby via the android tile drop down- Samsung bloatware can be disabled and removed, but I imagine the Samsung integrations could be useful to people who are all-in with the Galaxy line- This tablet is light! Very light. This is a MAJOR plus for gaming.- The size of this tablet is perfect for holding for gaming.- Battery life is great so far- No lag in any games tried so far. I was skeptical this would perform, but I've yet to find anything it has trouble with.I recommend the 128gb version, as the RAM is tied to internal storage as there's 2 models: 64gb internal storage + 4gb RAM, or 128gb internal storage + 6gb ram. Don't cheap out and get stuck with 4gb internal ram, 6gb will make this device last.I put a 512gb U3 (faster upload, don't cheap out, cheaper cards are likely U1) SD card in this so I'll never have storage trouble.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I purchased this for my wife to replace her now-ancient Galaxy Tab S that was frequently rebooting itself. I tracked down what I thought was a good keyboard case to pair with it, as my wife types a fair amount and finds a BlueTooth connected physical keyboard a much needed accessory. We quickly found that there aren't any quality keyboards out there for the tablet, and that kills the productivity of the tablet for us.  Her previous keyboard was a Logitech, and they no longer make them for tablets.  That leaves you to pick from either the no-name Chinese offerings on here or the incredibly pricey (and yet not well-rated) Samsung offering.  We finally decided the cost of this combo wasn't worth the downgraded experience so we returned it.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I love the speed of this tablet. The camera takes much better photos than my last tablet. I love the way when you're watching a youtube vid, you can go to another site, and the vid continues to play in a smaller screen while you go to other websites.

"I've owned more than a half a dozen tablets.  The first three were iPads.  I was annoyed at having the limited storage space with the closed iPad system.  This tablet has the best screen and with the 128 gbs of internal storage and the 512 expandable micro sd storage I may never need another tablet.  I travel a lot and the ability to carry  tons of  GOT and movies is invaluable.  The 6 gb of RAM makes this  tablet incredibly fast.  Overall, this is the best tablet that I have ever owned.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"The set up wizard was a challenge.  I got stuck with the voice assistant when setting up  and it was only by trial and error that I found out that you had to touch one icon or type each character once and then two times fast in succession.  Touch screen commands were initially sluggish and erratic.  Everything about it was slow.  After the teething problems were solved, it behaved as I had hoped and I am glad to say now that I am pleased with it.  The extra storage of 128 GB is worth the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I replaced my old Samsung tablet with this one.  It's a lot quicker with a better screen, a a bit larger.  It is very thin, so I recommend you get a case of some sort.  It does take a little getting used to because there is no ""home""  button on the front of the tablet.  You drag it up from the bottom on screen.  The internal speakers are very good, and you have no trouble hearing anything you are playing.  Saw some negative comments about no headphone jack, but you actually have one with the adapter supplied in the box.  A very nice tablet especially if you don't want to spend a fortune on an iPad.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Did my research before purchasing and the tablet performs how I expected. My only complaint, which I was aware before purchase, is no native DNLA support. I love samsung entertainment products and have them throughout my home. Phones, TVs, tablets... (their washer/dryers are meh, but that's a story for another day.)  They haven't had native DNLA since the Galaxy S5 (maybe s6, skipped that phone) which is just silly. Other than that, screen-awesome, operating system-awesome, speakers-awesome for a tablet. Easily customizable, great parental controls through making non-administrator profiles for the kids and lots of nice accessories it supports. It does everything and more for half the price compared to its Apple equivalent.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"The S5e in and of itself is a great product. The screen quality and resolution is amazing. Battery life, at least with short usage at this point, is great. Only complaint product wise would be the fact that the tempered glass screen is a fingerprint MAGNET. The price you pay for such a gorgeous display i suppose.Buyer beware: the 4 month Youtube Premium promotion advertised above is not valid for the S5e. Upon contacting Samsung they notified me this was only valid for the Galaxy 10 and Galaxy note 9.  I was advised to contact Amazon who stated this was a Samsung issue in terms of them creating the store page advertisement. You can see where this is going. Long story short, the 4 month FREE YouTube premium subscription will not be honored. To date, Amazon has not even corrected the advertisement.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I have a Galaxy Tab S3 as well and I wanted this to use for e-books, email and web browsing.  I got it because of the good price and features.  I didn't need the latest Chipset for speed, etc.  It works great and is very responsive.  I love the smaller bezels and the screen layout (dimensions).  I haven't streamed any media yet but that should work just fine as well.  I have never needed a stylus so for the money this is a great device.  I really love it and recommend this tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I am a fan of Galaxy Tab s-series. Before buying S5e I owned S2, S3, and S4. I especially like the screens, which for me is the most important part of the table. S4 was somewhat of a let-down: face (iris) recognition is flaky, and glass back panel is easy to crack. S5e beats S4: lighter, more durable, great fingerprint sensor position in addition to an excellent screen quality. S5e is also priced better than S4 (or S6). This comes at the expense of the S-pen, so if you really want one, you have to go with something else. I have not used S-pen much on my previous tablest, so this is not an issue for me.I took one star off due to two design shortcomings of S5e:1. The WIFI version does not support vibrate mode for the ringer. Come on, Samsung, this is a stupid decision!2. Antenna design is bad, holding the tablet by the bottom left corner in landscape mode reduces signal strength. Transfer speeds suffer, especially when the signal is weak, and the range is shorter. I found that with a case, the problem is not as bad, and most places I use the tablet have strong signal, so I can live with this, but if you have a weak signal, you should take this problem into account.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"I received the tablet a few days ago and absolutely loved it!  The video quality and sound are great, it was easy to use and set up, and it is lightweight.  I am replacing and ipad and found this easier to use, not because it's right or wrong, but because it is more Windows based and that's what I am accustomed to.  I bought the Finite keyboard cover and loved that also.  Paired up easily and the keyboard has a nice feel to it.  However, the S-Pen was not in the box even though it is checked in the comparison table.  Come to find out, it doesn't appear to be compatible with this tablet.  Additionally, although it is advertised as Verizon LTE + WiFi, I took it to the Verizon store today and it will not work with that network.  I was very disappointed because I was getting attached.  However, Amazon customer service was very easy to work with, very apologetic, and made it right with a full refund for both the tablet and the keyboard cover.

"I got my 128GB Galaxy Tab S5e in February 2020 and gave it one star after it bricked at the end of 24 hours. I got my replacement from Amazon two days later and upgraded this review to five stars. I’m delighted with this tablet, and with the Chesona $45 keyboard-case that I separately reviewed.Pros:First of all, there’s no more wireless degradation when you touch the bottom screen corners in landscape mode. This problem is history.Great screen and the best tablet sound I’ve ever heard. I intend to use this tab mostly as a small general purpose laptop, and it’s working out perfectly for that purpose.I love having the fingerprint sensor built into the power button! After setting up Smart Unlock, I don’t even have to press a button or the screen to fully awaken the tablet. I just lightly touch the power button. This is very easy to get used to.I love being able to copy files to/from my Tab S5e and my Windows 10 PC with just a USB-to-USB-C cable and no software add-ons required on either side. This is life as it should be but hasn’t been lately. I have (and love) a Pixel 3a XL phone, not a Samsung Galaxy phone, so some of the direct file transfer features aren’t available to me.Cons:Crapware is much more pervasive and evil than on most Androids. Example: I can’t use the Samsung Adobe Acrobat app without divulging my date of birth. Really?  Another example: A built-in app called Samsung Flow has a solitary bad review in the Galaxy Essentials crapware repository, with a Samsung reply written in broken, unintelligible English. Hey Samsung: If you can’t be bothered to communicate with your customers in their own language, what does that tell us about the attention to detail you apply to your app design? Another example: “Bixby” wins all awards for the most evil app ever spawned. It occupies the entire screen just to the left of the home screen. If you choose not to use it, you can’t even view that screen! If you do, you’ll be endlessly prompted to upgrade and install. Even then, you don’t get the left screen back.I would have deducted a star for the extra-infuriating crapware, except that Samsung made installation optional for most of them. A few are actually useful, such as My Files, which is the best Android file manager I’ve seen yet. And the built-in calculator and calendar with their simple, effective design.Everything considered, I highly recommend this tablet. Just not as highly as if Samsung took Google’s minimalist approach to the built-in apps.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"The sound and screen quality just blew us away. A great tablet that proves ""paper specs"" are worthless. The chip set in this tablet works just fine and the speed is on par with anything in this class. You can actually watch a movie on this tiny screen and enjoy it.  We shied away at first because of experiences with Samsung Galaxy phones (bloatware and Bixby) but this tablet has none of that. There is a silent ""Bixby Page"" but it is actually useful in this scenario. This outclassed my daughter's iPad so much that she purchased the Samsung Tab S5e for herself and handed down the iPad.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I love this tablet. It is fast, has plenty of storage, and runs everything I need it to. I use it to take notes on daily stuff, keep track of my calendar, and for some things in my coding classes. I am currently working towards a Computer Engineering degree and right now am getting close to SQL certification. Everything I have done on it has worked great. One of the best features is the thumb print access. I love being able to open my tablet quickly, but also knowing that it is secure from other people.Some of the apps I use are Microsoft365(especially word, note, and excel), Googleapps, theBibleApp, RememberMe, Kahn Academy,  and a ton of educational apps. Because I go to school online, I needed a tablet that can quickly run all of the educational apps involved.My favorite internal process is being able to quickly clean up my storage, memory usage, and battery usage. And speaking of battery, this battery charges quickly and lasts a long time. I use my tablet all day long, and it usually lasts for a couple days.Overall this is the best tablet I have owned. I would recommend it to everyone. The only downside is that it is not compatible with the S-pen. But I chose to save the money as I did not need those features. For the price I think this is one of the best tablets on the market and beats out many that are higher priced, especially for most peoples needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is a must buy if you are only looking for a decent Samsung tablet for media consumption. You could always go for the cheaper Tab A 10.1 (2019) version (another great tablet). However, the speed and audio quality is better on the Tab S5E.Pros:1) Excellent display2) Excellent speakers3) Light weight4) Thin Bezels5) Decent Cameras (for a tablet)Cons:1) older Snapdragon CPU2) base RAM is 4 GB3) no headphone jack (joining the dongle life)4) no active pen support5) Samsung Dex support","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"So, I bought this(plus the keyboard and insurance) as a way to takes notes when studying as well as consuming content. Half of that works great. The screen is probably one of the better ones I've seen out there. The problem I have is that the product listing on the amazon website(see included picture) has a comparison chart that says this model has an included S pen. I thought, hey this one has everything including the pen. Unfortunately, this unit does not have a pen and after doing more research, does not even support the feature. Returning and upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6(SM-T860NZAAXAR) that does include the S Pen would be a difference of about $220+...so I'm pretty darn disappointed. Please fix this problem Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"The display is beautiful--bright colors and crisp resolution. The touch screen works well with your finger, but it's not quite as responsive when using a stylus. I'd prefer using a stylus so the screen doesn't get smeared. But this is a minor inconvenience. It's great that the homepage and icons look just like my Android phone. It was easy to learn how to get around on the tablet. Battery life seems average, but I keep it plugged in most of the time despite some claims that doing so can shorten battery life on a device.The only thing that I really don't like is that it doesn't have a jack for earphones. You have to use the accompanying dongle to adapt the USB Type-C charging port to earphone use. That means you can't be charging the tablet and using earphones at the same time.Looks to me like the dongle is a weak spot on this tablet, too. The dongle's cable (about 2"" long) is made of thinner cable than I am comfortable with. It's quite flexible, and it doesn't appear to have sufficient strain relief built into it. I'm concerned that the dongle will wear out prematurely.  But, I'm sure a replacement dongle is a minimal expense. I just might buy a spare just to have it when it's time to replace the original one.I like that the tablet uses the USB Type-C charging port. To me, it's the best-designed of all the port styles. Type-C is a little bigger (so less fumbling around), and you can insert a cable into a Type-C either way. That's very convenient.I have few complaints about this tablet. I'd buy it again. The great display is it's best feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I purchased this to replace an old slow tablet. This tablet is very quick with a very good screen. The documentation is a bit sparse and a first time tablet user would have a steeper learning curve. No problem for an experienced user.I researched tablets and couldn't stomach a $700+ price for the top of the line ones when you could buy a computer for the same money. Tablet is thin and light weight and I very highly recommend it as a mid price performer.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Screen quality is great. Battery life compared to the older Galaxy Tab S, that this unit replaced, is simply terrific. The only flaw is the wifi antenna issue discussed in other reviews. If you are in a strong wifi hotspot, then you are fine. However, if you are in a weak wifi hotspot, establishing and maintaining a wifi connection is problematic at best. My older Galaxy Tab S will function perfectly in a weak wifi hotspot, but the TabS5e simply can't consistently establish and maintain a network connection. Obviously a flaw in Samsung's design and QA testing procedures to not spot this critical issue. Still for 80 percent of where I will be using this device (all strong wifi hotspots), the Tab S5e works well.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"My son loves it; uses the DEV feature with a USB-C to HDMI and this is his new laptop.  It's better than my laptop in DEX mode; but I can't tell him that!He does his homework in Google docs, watches youtubes while he's doing homework; all the 9 yards.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Love it! This is a replacement for my original galaxy tab s that is six years old and still works fine except for charging port is loose and I've run out of storage. I am amazed at how far they have come on these tablets. I recommend this for people who don't use them for work. It's very light weight and I like the larger screen. Harder to travel with however, this doesn't fit my regular purse like the older one. I did purchase through Amazon warehouse and saved a lot of money, it was only missing the manual and still had remaining warranty, only short a couple months. Otherwise not a single scratch or defect. Would recommend this option for anyone light on funds.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is not my first Samsung tablet but it may be my last. My wife has an S2 and we can sit right next to each other and she will get a good signal and I will get a poor to no signal. I go to google play store and I have to reset to the original version on the tablet to be able to download anything. All other devices work fine when downloading. I think Samsung needs to do some upgrading and backtracking before they charge over $400.00 for it. I wouldn't buy until they make some changes.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Though Google creates and updates Android, the most used OS in the world, this tablet does not allow for the installation of Google's Messages which I use to sync with Google Web Messages.  That is very disappointing.  I imagine the fault lies with Samsung who also adds numerous apps that I have no use for.The above complaints aside, the tablet is very nice and the screen looks excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I had to return this tablet because it would absolutely refuse to connect to my WIFI right out of the box. It's a shame because the screen and body is absolutely gorgeous but keep in mind this tablet has a history with WIFI problems, wheather it keeps disconnecting or just never connects at all to the WIFI. Would NOT recommend anyone to buy this.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"If you're trying to decide between a a Galaxy Tab s5e and an iPad, I suggest the s5e.  This new addition to the Galaxy Tabs is sleek and elegant.  You can  compare  specs on  your own.  I had an iPad for the last ten years.  Despite all its cachet,  it had limitations that were hard to live with.  Didn't support a mouse.  Didn't support Adobe, which I needed for some of my volunteer data entry  work. Android seems to have caught up with Apple in the intuitiveness of operations.  Creating desktop app files is a snap. It allows me to add apps from file drawer which is alphabetized for this operation.  Which brings me to a complaint.  The Google app file on the desktop isn't alphabetized which makes finding apps when I'm not adding to an existing file a wee bit more burdensome.  But not a serial-killer.Time will tell if this s5e lasts as long as iPad did.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"I was somewhat reluctant to purchase his based o some of the wifi problem comments, but took a chance anyway and bought one for my wife and myself.  After 2 months use, the tablets have worked well and neither one of us has had any wifi issues at all.  I have deliberately tried to hold the tablet in the manner that was reported to cause wifi issues and had none.  The only thing I can think of is that those who were having problems either had an earlier unit and the issue was fixed before I got mine, or that their wifi signal was marginal - just a couple of guesses.  Anyway, we are very satisfied with the tablets.One thing to note:  I purchased one case that did not allow enough room for the fingerprint sensor.  I returned that one and bought another that works great.  I have no fingerprint sensor issues and that function works reliably for me and my wife.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This tablet has too much defected and their customer service is lacking. Try to login Facebook but it Froze and would not allow me to restart the tablet. Contacted the representative they told me to wait until the battery died and reset the tablet. While i was waiting for the battery to die the tablet started to heat up. 6 days old and had to ship it back to Samsung for repair. Instead of fixing my tablet or offering me a new one. They told me they have no inventory in stock and offer me a refund which is lower then what I paid for.  This is NOT ACCEPTABLE","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I am using one of Samsung Galaxy smartphone series, and this pad is well paired with my phone! It has a big and clear screen and fascinating design. Light weight. It works well at YouTube, Google Chrome, etc. This pad well enables my blue-tooth keyboard to be paired. I'm not heavy game user, so I cannot tell anything with game play with this pad. Lastly, I am weighing a lot on storage enhancement. I paid for only 64GB not that big storage. But I can insert small card to increase total storage!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Love it, sound is amazing, the Dolby atomas coupled with 4 speakers makes for a very immersive sound expieriance for a tablet. It's no sonos speaker but for a tablet it's incredible. The screen resolution and color is perfect the amoled screen makes such a difference comming from standard screens. The brightness is great. Samsung DeX is awesome, some people give it hate, but I think its misplaced it really makes the tablet turn into the feel of a laptop and makes multitasking extremely seamless and easy. Only thing I dont like is no S pen support, I kind of wish I went with a 6 for that reason but didnt want to spend 650.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"I really like this tablet so far. The touch screen works great, the colors are beautiful and the sound is amazing. Just for a test I played some Spotify music on it and I couldn't believe how nice the sound was. I had read another reviewer complain that there was no earphone jack. However, mine came with a converter from the USB port to a earphone jack. It works perfectly! It is incredibly thin so I would suggest you order a case right away. The battery life seems to be just as described.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"When it comes to choosing a tablet there are simply six relevant factors: (1) screen; (2) battery; (3) weight; (4) OS; (5) pen; (6) price.  Pick your dealbreakers and your answer will be revealed.  Apple aficionado?  iPad or bust.  Has to have a pen?  Waste no further time on the S5e.  Budget tablet?  Grab a Fire HD 10 and don't look back.If, however, you value a truly exemplary 2560x1600 AMOLED screen, the lightest 400 gram tablet available anywhere in the iOS/Android tabletverse, and desire a standout battery and reasonable price, the S5E is it.  I received mine a couple weeks ago and have barely been able to put it down since.  For $350 this is a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"We got this tablet and then ordered a replacement because we thought we got a bad one...nope. Nice tablet and beautiful screen, but when you switch to picture app all the views have a greenish tint. And yes, if you take a picture it has a greenish tint. Both of the units we tried did this. Reset to factory settings and still does it. Cannot be corrected with the onboard color correction. Returned them both and got a Tab A. Not as nice a tablet, but it takes a normal picture. Very, Very, Very disappointing.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Tablet was great until the screen starting having color bleed that progressively got worse over a few days. This was 8 months after purchase, well within the 1 yr warranty. However, Samsung will not honor the warranty because the serial number of the device is not printed on the receipt. This is a ridiculous requirement that no retailer has the capability of meeting, and obviously put in the fine print by Samsung to avoid having to make good on warranty claims. A search on the web returns many similar stories from other Samsung customers.The tablet was very nice and worked great until it failed. If you do buy this tablet make sure you purchase 3rd party coverage for the device. An expensive learning experience on my part.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"The Samsung Galaxy S5e Tab is a beautiful well  built tablet, I like everything about it so far! The only fault I find is with the battery, which is advertised as lasting 14.5 hours on a full charge. So, I expect to watch at least 5 two hour movie on a full charge, which doesn't live up the it's claim. Still I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking to buy a really beautiful, well made  tablet. That's the reason I bought it in the first place.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"I did not buy my Samsung Tab S5e from Amazon. My son bought mine from Best Buy, the 64 GB Silver, as a birthday gift and I am loving it. I have had ZERO issues with Wifi connectivity in either portrait or landscape mode as other reviewers have stated. Just to test it out I kept the Tab S5e in landscape mode all day in my hands while watching movies, reading, creating a budget spreadsheet, and surfing the net in bed and had no signal disruption whatsoever, not even the slightest buffering. My modem is in my living room.The Galaxy Tab S5e is super lightweight and thin, the screen is absolutely gorgeous, the speakers are the LOUDEST I have ever heard on a Samsung tablet, the multitasking is even better with the Android Pie OS (I'm ecstatic about finally having a dark mode on my tablet), the UI is fast and buttery smooth, the battery has lasted the last 2 days without requiring a charge yet, and there are even more customization options to choose from with Good Lock. The standard headphone hack would have been an added bonus, but I just paired my bluetooth earbuds and the sound is stellar. I fully expect to get 6-7 years of service from this device as I did my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, which is still working fine but not receiving any more updates. I highly recommend this device with no hesitation. Someday I will put mine down, but not anytime soon.😂😂😂","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"i don't like the fact that its just WiFi based and still trying to check if it uses sim cards in case i travel to areas without WiFi connections readily available. this reduces the number of buyers. e.g like Africa","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"I've thrown just about everything at this tablet and it has handled even the most demanding tasks with ease.  I find it's comfortable enough to be my ""go-to"" tablet at home, and powerful enough to replace my desktop for referencing/annotating PDF files or light note-taking at meetings. I love the DeX feature, where you can turn the tablet into a windows-like interface. Be aware, however, that only certain applications support resizing of the default window size (about 1/4 of the screen) that you create on the desktop.  This tablet doesn't have an S pen but it works beautifully with every stylus I've used on it, and is responsive enough to record handwriting.  I paired it with a foldable bluetooth keyboard/trackpad for work activities, which gives the combo enough functionality to be a lighter version of my laptop.  I recommend a ""tri-fold"" style slim case for this one - the fold becomes a handle that you can use to hold the tablet in portrait mode if you're reading a kindle book, an online newspaper, etc.  You will want a case for this, because like the samsung phones, the rear camera lens sticks out beyond the back panel of the unit and could easily scratch on a table.My only gripe is the lack of a headphone jack. That being said, Samsung does include a dongle to connect your headphones to the USB-C port. The only drawback is that you can't power the unit and listen to wired headphones at the same time.  The speaker sound quality of the s5e is stunning for such a small device. This is due to its 4-speaker system, one upper and one lower on each side of the screen, which is perfect for watching movies.  It won't fill up a room like a separate speaker but it does a decent job.Samsung has also built in a memory and storage optimizer that comes with a widget that enables you to do  one-click cleanup.  I appreciate not having to use one of the ""free"" ones at the Android store that come with a million ads.  This is a solid tablet with unbelievable performance, great video and audio quality.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This is an honest review with valid trial and error. Just a disclosure, i have gone through 5 different units of the Galaxy Tab S5e black 128GB, 6GB RAM. I went through 5 different units because each unit was defective. I love Samsung and i own a Galaxy S10, which i love. But they really need to work on their quality control. The first two units i had, both had warped glass screens on the right side where the volume rockers are. And also warped where the type C charging port is. I thought i had bad luck and had 2 units with these issues. But if you already own a Tab S5e, take a look at your tablet and i can guarantee it is not flat. It will be warped on the right side of the table along the edge of the volume rockers and the usb type c ports. You can do this my running your fingers along the edge. Im pretty sure this is factory, but if im paying this much for a tablet i want it to be perfect. After exchanging it twice. I received the 3rd unit. This unit had a defective finger print scanner. It would not ready my fingerprint no matter what. It also had wifi issues when held in landscape. And yes it is an issue. Some may say they have no issues. But i spent about a hour testing it and each time the wifi dropped. This was apparent to 4/5 units i had. After returning and exchanging that unit i received my 4th unit. This unit again had fingerprint issues. I returned it and received my 5th and final unit. This unit still had slightly warped edges, just like all the units i had but the wifi was better. I was honestly just over the fact that Samsung is not consistent. And for the money i payed for the tablet i could wait for something better with a higher chipset and over all better build. I love Samsung but i wish they consider how much consumers are paying for their products. And make their products more premium. I have since then returned the Tab S5e all together. It is just not worth the hassle of all the defects for a mid level chipset. If youre going to use this just specifically for media consumption, then it will definitely be a nice experience. But if you cant help but think you could pay the same or a little more for something better, with a higher chipset and maybe even better media output, i would save your money and wait.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Stellar, mindblowing sound  from a tablet. I have the Tab S3 and the 2017 12.9"" version of the iPad pro and after listening to this tablet,  I'm going to sell the other two.Regarding the WiFi issue,  I've yet to lose a connection anywhere in my house.  My iPad Pro on the other hand,  which cost more than twice as much as this tablet,  with no known WiFi issues,  often drops the signal or buffers whatever movie I'm trying to stream to the point where I give up and download it instead.Screen is brilliant.  It's ridiculously light in the hand too.The only drawback is lack of third party accessories. There are hardly any cases out there and I'm not spending $$$$ on the vastly overpriced Samsung variant.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Samsung, I really do enjoy this tablet for what it is. It is powerful enough for the multitasking I do, the screen looks amazing, the sound is fantastic, the battery life is incredible, and I didn't even end up with the dreaded wifi signal loss (though it did drop a bar or two when I REALLY tried to cover the entire corner of the tablet).The facial recognition isn't quite as good as I had hoped. It could be my hair that gets in the way and makes it less accurate but it wasn't the reason I took a star off of this review. The fingerprint sensor was actually more reliable for me. Even with my torn up fingers, it seems to be the better option for me.But for the love of all that is holy on this earth, stop copying Apple. Stop trying to remove the headphone jack because it is completely useless to do so. The only thing it does for the end user is make things complicated when you want to use regular analog headphones.Be an individual Samsung. Leave Apple alone to lock down their devices like the fascists they are. You are better than this Samsung. I hope you find your own way in the future. As you have in the past.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"Regarding the Wss wifi issue I did verify that there is a issue that anyone can confirm using speedtest.net. The download speed drops off up to 80% when the antenna is covered with your hand. Didn't matter what orientation you have the device in. The signal strength is reduced as occurs when you hold the device in landscape mode. It depends on your signal strength if it drops off completely. Some may be ok with this I decided to return as I do believe it is enough of an issue to return. Darn shame as otherwise it is a nice device and would have ed liked to keep it.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"LIKES-AMAZING screen OLED display saves battery and clarity is awsome.Long batter lifeAndroid 9 Pie is the best yet and is pre-installed.Metal body-great build qualityNight mode to eliminate all the white background-saving battery life.Dislikes-Internal antenna position-if you hold in landscape with camera to your left, you may loose internet connection if you already have a weak signal otherwise you will be ok. Your hand covering the lower corner cuts down signal by 2 bars.No headphone jack, I think it's because the tablet is so thin it cant be included. But it does have an adapter usb c to headphone jack included. I have yet to try it. If it works you just can't charge and listen at the same time.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"Outstanding tablet. Have always used an IPad, but since Apple has no intention of producing an OLED iPad, I caved and bought this one. It turned out a lot better than I expected. The keyboard case is also excellent, but the quality of the cloth backing is rather cheap and disappointing. Wish they made it out of a more premium material like leather.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Probably should avoid this tablet. Wifi drops in landscape mode, and is not as good as my other devices' wifi no matter which way I hold it. If you spend most of your tablet time close to your router, you might be ok with it. A shame Samsung blew it on such an important part of the tablet, because it is pretty nice otherwise.  The sound is particularly good.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought this tablet and the 2019 ipad (10.2"") and did my own side-by-side comparison.  Some things are subjective, but in my comparison of things that matter to me, this tablet won the comparison hands down.  The Samsung is physically smaller (narrower and shorter) while having a slightly larger screen (10.5 vs 10.2).  Whether you prefer a taller, wider tablet, or the taller, thinner Samsung is a matter of personal preference, but for me the Samsung is easier to handle and I like the distribution of the screen area better.  Even more important, the sharpness and brightness of the display on the screen is far superior to the ipad.  The ipad weighs slightly more but because of the wider/taller size I didn't detect any real difference in that department.  However, when I compared the sound and loudness there was truly no comparison.  The Samsung crushed the ipad.  I was amazed at the difference in that area.  So, with the prices being very similar, the choice was obvious for me - the Samsung.  I awarded a 4 star because I have only owned the tablet for a few days and cannot honestly comment on the battery life.  Nevertheless, my overall impression of this tablet is good and I am pleased with the choice I made.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I want to love this tablet but I am having trouble. I love everything accept this 1 thing, which is a biggy. I have super fast internet but the processor sucks to me. For the newest processor, pages load soooooo much slower for me now. My 2.5 year old Samsung tablet loads all my pages way faster still. I've gone through all my settings checked everything. It's really quite sad to me. Anyone else feel this way or is it just me?","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"I bought a huwaei mediapad m5 three weeks ago... and returned it for this bad boy! This is a significantly better tablet! It has the same specs and an AMOLED screen for only $80 more!","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I wish I could be more positive but this tablet is just flawed. The first big problem is that the screen is not sufficiently sensitive to your touch and sometimes it just won't respond when you tap it to do something.  This is especially annoying when the menu buttons at the bottom slide away and you can't get them back when you want to do something.  The second problem is that it often completely freezes up to the point where I have to reboot before I can continue, and lose whatever I was doing.  Big expensive disapointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"The 5e does not include an S-Pen in the box, nor does it support an S-Pen if you already have one. The comparison chart in this product listing claims that it does. It is inaccurate.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I went with the S5e because I didn't care to spend the extra money for the S6. I got the 128GB version with extra RAM and threw in a 400GB microSD to try to add to its longevity (I used my previous 2014 Tab S for 5 years). I love this tablet. I cannot get over how thin and light it is for the size of screen it provides. As soon as I think I've gotten used to it, I pick up the tablet the next day and am wowed again. Provided Samsung stays on top of OS updates, I'm going to get a ton of use out of this thing and highly recommend it. Build quality is fantastic, the screen is top notch, and sound is great. The device is so thin I don't even care that I have to use the included adapter if I care to use wired headphones. The only downside I've noticed about the tablet is the WiFi antenna is towards the top left corner (if holding in portrait) and if you put your hand over that corner, perhaps if you rotate it to the left into landscape, you can notice the WiFi signal drop. This is easily avoided by simply rotating the tablet to the right into landscape.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I purchased this tablet from Best Buy on Sunday 3-29-20 and had to pick it up from the store the next day. I picked it up that Monday after work and immediately turned it on while still at Best Buy.  I waited in the parking lot for 10 minutes and it never loaded past the Samsung logo. Of course I took it back to the guys at curbside at BB and they confirmed it was defected. They ordered me another, waived the shipping fee and had it delivered to me 2day UPS. I received it today 4-1-20 and it's doing thee EXACT same thing not booting up past the Samsung screen. I drove to that same BB upset because I paid $600 for a product that was clearly poorly made and because of the inconvenience. Buyers Beware of this problem!!! There are people on Amazon and other review sites that have had the same issue. This isn't a Best Buy issue, they were great! This is a Samsung issue and the fact that they make poor quality tablets and products sometimes. I had a Samsung tab S 8.4 and the screen flickered and would shut off. I wanted to give Samsung another try because I do own and have owned several Note phones and besides the Note 7 fire issue I've been relatively pleased with the product. I'm highly disappointed in Samsung and was really looking forward to using this while quarantined and because my wife had gotten it as a birthday gift. Never again Samsung unless it's given to me for free!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I had a ton of connectivity issues with my new tab A so I took it back and got this one. I like this one soooooo much better. Everything about it is smoother, faster, better video. There is a connectivity issue occassionally if I am holding it with the lower left corner, but this seems to be resolved with the cover. Anyway I'm glad I finally have an awesome tablet that works well for me. It was a royal pain dealing with the connectivity problems with the 10.1. Samsung was not much help at all. This one is working great so far though.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"I tried the one my buddy owns.  It's fabulous of course and I really wanted it, until I learned it didn't have a headphone jack. This is insane to not put one on a tablet, therefore I am stuck having to buy a different brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"The tablet was barely used for more than a month, and it's having a crazy slow charging issue. Doesn't matter if I change different types of super chargers, it'll always show slow charging. Screens and sounds are great, but it's useless if power input is lower than output. It charges slow and you can't use it more than 2-3 hours, because it'll shut down. Just google that issue, and I'm definitely not the only one having this issue. I'm assuming I just got lucky having this hardware defect. This will be the last samsung tablet purchase. I just realized my older tablet have the same issue, but I don't use that one that often to notice the issue.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"I did not buy mine on Amazon.  I have the 64GB/4GB version.  I got it via Samsung's trade in program (traded in a Note 8, and got the tablet for $200).  It has a fantastic screen.  The processor is fast enough.  And 4GB of ram is plenty for everything I do Numerous browser tabs, multiple apps, and Netflix/Amazon Prime in HD simultaneously didn't slow it down at all.  It is ultra-thin and adding a cover case keeps it very thin.  I generally don't care about speaker quality on tablets, as I usually use headphones, but this tablets quad speakers sound pretty great.  Plenty of volume, surprising really,  I had videos playing at 3/4 volume and they were plenty loud.  I haven't tested the cameras, but I will likely never use them other than for a video call.The big negative is more to do with Samsung (and others) policy to disallow adoptable storage to force sales of 128GB models.  It is an archaic business practice.  Had I not been able to get this tablet for roughly $215 (ignoring the price I paid for the Note 8 a couple of years ago), I would not have bought it for just that reason.  Being the only mid-to-high end android tablet in the game gives them the economic leeway to overcharge, but this tablet @ 64GB without adoptable storage isn't worth the retail price (and definitely not so for the 128GB model), in my opinion.Fantastic tablet (5*) at a discount, and if you don't need the internal storage for apps (or don't want to root your tablet).  At retail price, it is still the best tablet (only tablet) in its class.  I would've gone with a Chuwi or like Chinese brand, even though you cannot do HD Netflix and such due to DRM, had I not been able to trade in.Minus 1 star for Samsung's BS, and had the tablet not been so good otherwise it would've been docked 2 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"Everything is better but weak CPU and GPU. Rear camera is junk. I want it to support 4K 60FPS but only 1080P. so sorry I won't buy. and only 64 & 128GB version which is not enough. For 2019, storage should start with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB. and last con is screen is not big enough. I want 15 inches tablet.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"All is good except, no 3.5mm audio jack and sound quality output from the USB-C to audio jack is extremely poor and weak even at its max volume. What a shame audio jack option for such a high spec tablet. That USB-C to audio jack adapter cable also very thin and flimsy, not sure when it's going to break, output extremely poor quality sound to ear phones. UNACCEPTABLE for this audio jack option. If you're considering using it with conventional head set with 3.5mm audio jack you can forget about getting this tablet. Its sound is not even on par with the lowest end tablet you can find in the market.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Until now my all-time fav tablet was the Tab S3 purchased in 2013 - so thin, so light, great screen and days of battery life. But in the immortal words of Travolta playing the Archangel Michael: Nothing lasts. So I began my search for a replacement. The Tab S5e is almost as thin, larger in size, heavier, but still just as awesome. The screen is fantastic, as is the sound. I often said that the S3 was the perfect size, but the S5e is still great. It makes a perfect mobile TV with great audio to set on the kitchen counter or wherever. Highly recommended.Note: I don't care about or use any of the annoying assistants so no clue how well they work.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Amazing tablet. Very impressed with the screen quality and also the build quality.  I have tested the issue with my device and while it does reduce the signal it has never stopped a game or video that I've been watching.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I crossed my fingers with this purchase. I purchased the 128 g model and was on sale for 50.00 off. Plus used an older tablet as a trade in. I have no wifi issues as others have reported. I use an inexpensive case...that does not cover the antenna area. Display is beautiful...sound very good for a tablet. Blue tooth connects perfectly with my older BT headphones. I will not miss the headphone connection at all. This is a really great upgrade from my S2.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"5 stars easily.  This tablet has to be at least for now,  the best money  buy for 2019. I really have no complaints about it,  the screen is outstanding....I don't know what the specs are but I just know it looks as good or better than my s10+.... maybe it's the large screen size.  Battery last at least 8 hrs streaming. Maybe my only complaint is,  the Samsung keyboard cost $140.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"...and it can't be changed.  In landscape orientation left is volume up and right is volume down.  How much would it have taken to make this settable?  Is this really a deal-breaker?  Probably not, but how else can I get Samsung to pay for their stupidity except by giving this a 1-* rating?  I will be glad to revise my rating to 5-* if they will release a software update that fixes this.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Bought this for primarily reading comic books and the 10.5 inch screen is darn near perfect for that. The only tablet that would be better is the iPad 11 inch, but it is $400 more expensive for not a ton if difference.If you're looking for the best comic reading tablet for the money, this is it. ComiCat is also the best app on android.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"This thing deserves more than 5 stars. I think the iPad is a nice product but the ones that look as good as this tablet cost over 2 times as much and lack SD card support. If you need to use a stylus get the tab s4, if you want to use a stylus and save some cash (like me, but bad move) get a rechargeable stylus. The cost to value on this is amazing. No wifi or performance issues. 4gb ram is enough for everything including gaming. The screen is the most beautiful thing I've seen. Samsung could improve the software though. Android in general needs more tablet apps. This will kind of be a bigger phone. Overall EXCELLENT product for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
